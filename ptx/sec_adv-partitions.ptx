  <title>Counting Partitions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_basic-quotient"/> we considered some ways to distribute items to recipients.  Most basic counting formulas can be thought of as counting the number of ways to distribute either distinct or identical items to distinct recipients.  For example, distributing <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> distinct recipients can be done in <m>n^k</m> ways, if recipients can receive any number of items, or <m>P(n,k)</m> ways if recipients can receive at most one item.  If the items are identical, the corresponding number of ways to distribute them are <m>\mchoose{n}{k}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if the recipients are not distinct?  Say we wish to distribute <m>k</m> books (either distinct or identical) to <m>n</m> identical boxes.  This is a perfectly natural extension, but we will see the answer is not.  First, let's get a feel for what this might look like for some small values of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>.

  <title>Partitions of Sets</title>

    <p>
      Recall that a <term>partition</term> of a set <m>A</m> is a set of subsets of <m>A</m> such that every element of <m>A</m> is in exactly one of the subsets.  Sometimes we will call the subsets that make up a partition <term>blocks</term>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-stirling">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Denote by <m>S(k,n)</m> the number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into exactly <m>n</m> subsets.  We call <m>S(k,n)</m> a <term>Stirling number (of the second kind)</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Note that we write <m>S(k,n)</m> instead of <m>S(n,k)</m> here because we try to use <m>k</m> for the number of elements being distributed and <m>n</m> for the number of recipients.  When other books use <m>S(n,k)</m>, they mean the number of partitions of <m>[n]</m> into exactly <m>k</m> blocks.  This is the same definition as we give, but with renamed variables, formulas might look different.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, consider how to partition <m>[3]</m> into exactly two sets:
      <me>
        \{1,2\}, \{3\} \qquad \qquad \{1,3\},\{2\} \qquad \qquad \{2,3\},\{1\}
      </me>
      and that is all, so <m>S(3,2) = 3</m>.  We do not care about the order the elements appear in each block, nor the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus we see the Stirling numbers count the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> identical recipients so that each recipient gets at least one item.

            The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into <m>n</m> parts in which
            <m>k</m> is in a block with other elements of <m>[k]</m> is equal
            <m>n</m> times the number of partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into

            parts, and since it is in a block with other elements of
            <m>[k-1]</m>, removing it leaves a partition of <m>[k-1]</m> into
            <m>n</m> blocks. The number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into

        We have often thought of counting problems as asking about how many functions there are from a <m>k</m>-elements set to an <m>n</m>-element set.  The answer to this question is <m>n^k</m> for all functions and <m>P(n,k)</m> for injective functions.  What about surjective functions?  There is a reason we haven't asked this question yet, but now we can at least get an expression for the number of surjections in terms of Stirling numbers.

  <title>Partitions of Integers</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="compositionagian"/>, we counted the <em>compositions</em> of an integer <m>n</m>, by counting the number of solutions to the equation <m>x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n</m> where each <m>x_i</m> is a positive integer.  Put another way, we asked how many <em>lists</em> of <m>k</m> positive integers have sum <m>n</m>.  The order in which we listed the sum mattered.  What if it didn't?
    </p>
    <p>
      A multiset of positive integers that add to <m>n</m> is called a <term>partition</term><idx><h>partition of an integer</h></idx> of <m>n</m>. Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of <m>k</m> is denoted by <m>p(k)</m>; in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that <m>p(3) = 3</m>. It is traditional to use Greek letters like <m>\lambda</m> to stand for partitions; we might write <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, <m>\gamma= 2,1</m> and <m>\tau = 3</m> to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write <m>\lambda = 1^3</m> as a shorthand for <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, and we write <m>\lambda \dashv 3</m> as a shorthand for <q><m>\lambda</m> is a partition of three.</q>

        <p>
          The number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts is <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. We can divide the compositions into blocks, where two compositions are in the same block if and only if one is a rearrangement of the other. Then the blocks correspond bijectively to partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts. However we cannot compute the number of blocks by dividing by the number of compositions per block since the number of compositions per block ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n!</m>.  But then if we divide the number of compositions by <m>n!</m> we will get a number less than the number of blocks because <m>n!</m> times the number of blocks would be, by the sum principle, greater than the number of partitions.

            They are equal, because if we take two different partitions
            of <m>k-1</m> and increase the multiplicity of 1 in each (by one), they are
            still different; also if we take two different partitions of <m>k</m> that
            have parts of size one, and decrease the multiplicity of 1 in each (by
            one), they are still different.

    <p>
      When we write a partition as <m>\lambda = \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>, it is customary to write the list of <m>\lambda_i</m>s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector <m>(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)</m> for a partition, we write either <m>\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}</m> or <m>\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}</m>. Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write <m>\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}</m>, we will assume that <m>\lambda_i>\lambda_i+1</m>.
    </p>


    <p>
      The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list <m>(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)</m>, we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has <m>\lambda_1</m> equally spaced dots in the first row, <m>\lambda_2</m> equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge.

At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.

      With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set <m>S</m> of numbers if we remove the largest element of <m>S</m>. Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we can ask what we could remove from a Young diagram to get a Young diagram. 
      Two natural ways to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of <m>n</m> would be to remove the top row of the Young diagram of the partition and to remove the left column of the Young diagram of the partition. These two operations correspond to removing the largest part from the partition and to subtracting 1 from each part of the partition respectively. Even though these have some sort of geometric symmetry, the two operations are not symmetric with respect to the number of parts. Thus one might be much more useful than the other for finding a recurrence for the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts.

            How many parts does the remaining partition have when we remove the largest part (more precisely, we reduce its multiplicity by one) from a partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts?  What can you say about the number of parts of the remaining partition if we remove one from each part?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            These two operations do rather different things to the number of parts, and you can describe exactly what only one of the operations does. Think about the Young diagram.

        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Reducing the multiplicity of the largest part by one reduces the number of parts by one. Removing 1 from each part reduces the number of parts by the multiplicity of the smallest part, so it strictly reduces the number of parts, perhaps even to one.

            If we remove the largest part from a partition, what can we say about the integer that is being partitioned by the remaining parts of the partition? If we remove one from each part of a partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts, what integer is being partitioned by the remaining parts? (Another way to describe this is that we remove the first column from the Young diagram of the partition.)

        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If we remove the largest part, the integer being partitioned is <m>k</m> minus the largest part. Thus it is a number less than <m>k</m> and at least <m>n-1</m>. If we remove one from each part of the partition, the integer being partitioned is <m>k-n</m>.

            The last two questions are designed to get you thinking about how we can get a bijection between the set of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts and some other set of partitions that are partitions of a smaller number.  These questions describe two different strategies for getting that set of partitions of a smaller number or of smaller numbers.  Each strategy leads to a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts and a set of partitions of a smaller number or numbers.  For each strategy, use the answers to the last two questions to find and describe this set of partitions into a smaller number and a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts and partitions of the smaller integer or integers into appropriate numbers of parts. (In one case the set of partitions and bijection are relatively straightforward to describe and in the other case not so easy.)

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Here the harder part requires that, after removal, you consider a range of possible numbers being partitioned and that you give an upper bound on the part size. However it lets you describe the number of parts exactly.

(Removing the largest part gives us such a partition, and adjoining a part of size <m>k-k'</m> to such a partition gives us a partition of <m>k</m> with <m>n</m> parts.)

(Removing one from each part of a partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts gives us such a partition, and, given such a partition, we get a partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts by adding one to each part and then creating enough parts of size 1 to have <m>n</m> parts.)

            The second bijection is to the set of partitions of <m>k-1</m> into <m>n</m> or fewer parts, and this makes the second bijection sound easier to work with.

The proof is the bijection we already described; in particular a partition of <m>k-n</m> into <m>i</m> parts corresponds to the partition of <m>k</m> we get by adding one to each of the <m>i</m> parts and then creating <m>n-i</m> parts of size one.

            What would you want to fill into row 0 and column 0 of your table in order to make it consistent with your recurrence.  What does this say <m>p_0(0)</m> should be?  We usually define a sum with no terms in it to be zero. Is that consistent with the way the recurrence says we should define <m>p_0(0)</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If there is a sum equal to zero, there may very well be a partition of zero.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We would want to have <m>p_0(0)=1</m> and <m>p_0(k)=p_n(0)=0</m> for positive integer <m>k</m> or <m>n</m>. Since the sum of the empty multiset of positive integers is zero, this gives us one partition of the number zero, namely the empty multiset of positive integers.
          </p>

    <p>
      It is remarkable that there is no known formula for <m>p_n(k)</m>, nor is there one for <m>p(k)</m>. We have seen some ways to compute values of <m>p_n(k)</m>.  In <xref ref="sec_adv-linearparts"/> we will see more methods to compute values and find properties of these numbers even without ever knowing a formula for them.
