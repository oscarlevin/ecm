        On the table rest 8 dominoes, as shown below.  If you were to line them up in a single row, so that any two sides touching had matching numbers, what would the sum of the two end numbers be?

  <p>
    How might you use graph theory to solve the puzzle above?  One thing to try would be to create a graph consisting of six vertices, one for each value that appears on the dominoes.  Then connect the vertices if their numbers belong to the same domino.  This seems reasonable, but then how would you represent the line of matched up dominoes the puzzle requests?
  </p>

  <p>
    Say you start with domino <m>(4,6)</m>.  That is an edge in our graph.  Next we need to place a domino with a 6 on it (or a 4, but let's say the 4 will be an endpoint).  This amounts to selecting another edge, one that is incident to the vertex 6.  Say we pick <m>(6,5)</m>.  The edge we must select after that will need to be incident to vertex 5.  And so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The edges we select in the graph need to be linked up.  It makes sense to think about the selection of edges as traveling through the graph, moving along edges from vertex to vertex.  Let's capture this notion carefully.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-walk">
    <idx><h>walk</h></idx>
    <idx><h>trail</h></idx>
    <idx><h>path</h></idx>
    <idx><h>circuit</h></idx>
    <idx><h>cycle</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>walk</term> in a graph <m>G = (V,E)</m> is a sequence of vertices <m>v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> such that <m>\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E</m> for all <m>0 \le i \lt n</m>.  That is, consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent in the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>trail</term> is a walk that does not repeat any edges.  If the trail starts and ends at the same vertex (i.e., <m>v_1 = v_n</m>) then it is called a <term>circuit</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>path</term> is a trail that does not repeat any vertices, except perhaps for <m>v_0 = v_n</m>.  In the case that <m>v_0 = v_n</m>, the path is called a <term>cycle</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Do these definitions capture what a walk/trail/path should mean in a graph?  All three of these describe ways in which to move around in the graph, perhaps tracing along the edges without lifting up your pencil.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: some sources give slightly different definitions for these concepts.  For example, sometimes a walk is defined as a alternating sequence of vertices and edges <m>v_1e_1v_2e_2v_3\cdots e_{n-1}v_n</m> with the requirement that <m>v_i</m> is incident to <m>e_i</m>, which is incident to <m>v_{i+1}</m>.  We have not named our edges, so this definition would not make sense.  Another common way to define <em>path</em> is as a subgraph isomorphic to <m>P_n</m> for some <m>n</m>.  This is almost equivalent to our definition, except that we allow our paths to possibly be isomorphic to <m>C_n</m> for some <m>n</m> as well.  Some sources use <em>path</em> where we use <em>walk</em> and use <em>simple path</em> where we use <em>path</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walks and paths are useful for considering all sorts of graph theoretic concepts.  For example, you might want to find the <term>distance</term> between two vertices.  This would be defined as the shortest path starting at one and ending at the other (where the <term>length</term> of a path is the number of edges in it).  If you have a notion of distance, you can define the <em>center</em> and <em>radius</em> of a graph.  Graphs are <em>connected</em> provided between any two vertices, there is a path (or equivalently, a walk).

  <title>Euler paths and circuits</title>

  <p>
    To solve the domino problem, as well as the Bridges of Königsberg, we need to consider walks that use every edge exactly once.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-eulerpath">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A walk in a graph that uses every edge exactly once is called an <term>Euler path</term>.  An Euler path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called an <term>Euler circuit</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Although it is tradition, <em>Euler path</em> is a bad name.  These should be called an <term>Euler trail</term> or <term>Euler walk</term>, since by our definitions, an Euler path is usually not a path at all.  An Euler circuit is also sometimes called an <term>Euler tour</term>.

 So what does it take for a graph to have an Euler path or circuit?  Of course if a graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a path or circuit. For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.
</p>

<p>
The bridges of Königsberg problem is really a question about the existence of Euler paths. There will be a route that crosses every bridge exactly once if and only if the multigraph below has an Euler path:
</p>


<sidebyside width="22%">

  <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1, yscale=.5]
  \draw (-1,-2) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,0) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,2) \v to [out=300, in=60] (-1,0) to [out=300, in=60] (-1,-2);
  \draw (1,0) \v -- (-1,2) (-1,0) -- (1,0) -- (-1,-2);
  \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
  </image>
</sidebyside>

<p>
This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler path (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which do have an Euler path, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit, even if the graph is quite large.
</p>

<p>
One way to guarantee that a graph does <em>not</em> have an Euler circuit is to include a <q>spike,</q> a vertex of degree 1.
</p>
<sidebyside width="23%">
  <image>
  <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (-1,0) \v -- (0,1) \v -- (1,0) \v -- cycle;
    \draw (0,1) -- (1,1) \v node[below right]{\(a\)};
   \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
  </image>
</sidebyside>
<p>
The vertex <m>a</m> has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler path. It starts at the vertex <m>a</m>, then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of degree 3.
</p>

<p>
You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return, then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a path at, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex. The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.
</p>

<p>
What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices with odd degree, then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex <em>must</em> have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.
</p>

<p>
So there is clearly a connection between the parity of vertex degrees and Euler paths and circuits.  Here are two theorems the describe that connection.
</p>


<theorem xml:id="thm-eulercircuit">
<p>
  A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even.
  </p>
</theorem>
<theorem xml:id="thm-eulerpath">
  <p>
  A connected graph has an Euler path if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.
  </p>
</theorem>

<p>
We will need to prove these theorems, and doing so will give us an excuse to think about proving theorems in general.  However, note that these theorems answer the bridges of Königsberg problem.  The graph has all four vertices with odd degree, there is no Euler path through the graph.  Thus there is no way for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
  <title>Interlude: Implications and Proofs</title>
  <p>
    We would like to prove the theorems we conjectured above about Euler paths and circuits.  To help us understand how we could do this, and to make sure our proof is correct, we should take a few moments to recall some basic facts about mathematical statements, their logical form, and how this can help us in writing proofs.  A more detailed discussion of these topics is found in <xref ref="sec_background-logic">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="sec_background-proofs" type="global"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All mathematical statements have a <em>logical form</em> that determines the meaning of the statement and often suggests a method for proving (or disproving) the statement.  At the most basic level, a statement might be <term>atomic</term>, if it is not composed of simpler statements, or otherwise <term>molecular</term>.  A molecular statement is built up of smaller statements by connecting them with a <term>logical connective</term>.
    Such statements might be a <term>conjunction</term> (two statements connected by an <q>and</q>) a <term>disjunction</term> (two statements connected by an <q>or</q>), an <term>implication</term> or <term>conditional</term> (usually in the form <q>if <ellipsis /> then <ellipsis /></q>), or a <term>negation</term> (claiming a statement is <em>not</em> true).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other logical connectives, used both in mathematical statements and in ordinary language, but every one can be reduced to these four (actually, you can get away with as few as two of them).   For example, it is very common in mathematics to encounter statements of the form <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m>.</q>  This is called a <term>biconditional</term>, but it is nothing more than the conjunction of two implications.  That is, <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m></q> means <q>if <m>P</m> then <m>Q</m>, and if <m>Q</m> then <m>P</m>.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The truth of falsity of a molecular statement is determined entirely by the truth or falsity of its parts, governed by set rules of the connectives.  These rules can be communicated through <term>truth tables</term>.  We use the standard symbols <m>\wedge</m> for <q>and</q>, <m>\vee</m> for <q>or</q>, <m>\imp</m> for implications and <m>\neg</m> for negations.

    Note that the truth table for <m>P \vee Q</m> shows us that we always mean the <em>inclusive or</em>, in that when both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true, we say that <m>P \vee Q</m> is true.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other truth table worth looking closely at is the one for implications.  This might strike you as strange at first.  If <m>P</m> is false, the implication <m>P \imp Q</m> is true (no matter the truth value of <m>Q</m>).  Also, there is no need for <m>P</m> to <q>cause</q> <m>Q</m> to be true.  For example, the statement <q>If 2 is even, then 2 is prime</q> is true, despite there being no connection between the concepts of <q>even</q> and <q>prime</q>.

        Give three examples of implications which are true whose converse is false.  Then give three examples of implications which are true whose converse is true.

    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You might think about the relationship between a function being continuous and being differentiable.  Or a shape being a square or a rectangle.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </activity>

  <p>
    The claim <m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m> is the claim that both an implication and its converse are true.  This is the form that <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="thm-eulerpath" type="global"/> about Euler circuits and paths take.  Looking at the form, we see what it would take to prove them.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prove a biconditional, you simply must prove both implications (the implication and its converse).  How do you prove an implication though?  Well, by looking at the truth table, we see that we must prove that we are always in rows 1, 3, or 4.  The only case we need to exclude is the one where <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.
  </p>

  <p>
    So assume <m>P</m> is true (the other case is automatic).  Under this assumption, we argue that <m>Q</m> is true as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alternatively, we could start by assuming <m>Q</m> is false.  If we can then conclude that <m>P</m> is also false, we have excluded the one suspect case, as we can conclude that <m>P \imp Q</m>.  You could also conclude that <m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m>, which is the <term>contrapositive</term> of <m>P \imp Q</m>.  By comparing truth tables, it is easy to see that any implication is equivalent to its contrapositive, so proving a contrapositive is equivalent to proving its implication.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is one important piece we should mention here: the use of quantifiers.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is it possible for both a statement and its converse to be false?  What could you say about <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> for such a statement?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>

  <p>
    What about the statement, <q>if <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>p</m> is odd</q>.  This statement is false.  So is its converse.  But the truth tables for <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>Q \imp P</m> do not have a false in the same row.  So what is going on?
  </p>

  <p>
    The key is that we are secretly adding a <term>universal quantifier</term> in front of statements like this.  What we really mean is that <em>for all <m>p</m></em>, if <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>p</m> is odd.  This is false, because <em>there exists</em> (the <term>existential quantifier</term>) some counterexample.  The converse of the statement is, for all <m>p</m>, if <m>p</m> is odd, then <m>p</m> is prime.  This is also false, because there exists a counterexample.  Necessarily, it will be a different counterexample than the one that proved the implication was false.
  </p>

  <p>
    How do you prove a universally quantified statement is true?  You must prove the implication is true <em>for all</em> cases.  To prove that for all <m>n</m>, if <m>n^2</m> is even, then so is <m>n</m>, you must prove this for <m>n = 1</m>, <m>n = 2</m>, <m>n =3</m>, etc.  But to get on with your life, you might as well prove it for all of them at once.  Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.  Now prove the statement for that arbitrary <m>n</m>.  In this case, you might want to assume <m>n</m> is NOT even and prove that <m>n^2</m> is not even, to give a proof by contrapositive.  But since <m>n</m> was arbitrary, you have shown that your poof would work for <em>any</em> value of <m>n</m>.

  <title>Proofs for Euler Paths and Circuits</title>

  <p>
    Now let's try to prove <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="thm-eulerpath" type="global"/>.  Actually, we really only need to prove one of these, and the other one should follow from it.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Suppose we have already proved <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, that a graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.  Suppose now we want to prove <xref ref="thm-eulerpath"/>, that a graph has an Euler path if and only if it has at most two odd degree vertices.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a graph with an Euler path, how can you get a graph that definitely has an Euler circuit?  How did this affect the number of odd degree vertices?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Add something to your graph so you can <q>finish</q> the Euler path.  Don't forget to consider the case that the start and end vertex are already adjacent.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> be the begining and ending vertices of the Euler path.  Now add a vertex <m>v'</m>to the graph and edges <m>\{v_b, v'\}</m> and <m>\{v', v_e\}</m>.  Now the Euler path can be extended through <m>v'</m> and back to <m>v_b</m>, completing an Euler circuit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          By <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, we know our new expanded graph will have all vertices of even degree.  But the degrees of <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> have increased by 1, so in the original graph, it must be that <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> (and only these) had odd degree.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Note that if <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> were not adjacent in the original graph, we could have just added an edge connecting them, but adding the new vertex works in that and the case where the vertices were already adjacent.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a graph with at most two odd degree vertices, build a graph that has only even degree vertices.  If you have an Euler circuit of your new graph, what would that Euler circuit become if you looked at your original graph?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          If there are no odd degree vertices, you are done.  If there are two, you could connect them with an edge, except maybe they are already adjacent.  What could you do then?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m> be the two vertices with odd degree.  We can add a new vertex <m>v'</m> and edges <m>\{v_1, v'\}</m> and <m>\{v_2, v'\}</m>, which increases the degrees of <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m> by 1, making their degrees even.  Also, <m>d(v') = 2</m>, so all vertices now have even degree.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If this new graph has an Euler circuit, then we can <q>cut</q> out the path <m>(v_2, v', v_1)</m>.  Specifically, rotate and possibly reverse the circuit so that it starts at <m>v_1</m> and ends with the sequence <m>v_2, v', v_1</m>.  Then simply remove <m>v', v_1</m> from that sequence, to get a Euler path.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What do each of the above tasks demonstrate?  That is, write a proof of <xref ref="thm-eulerpath"/> assuming <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>.  Make sure you specify how each <q>direction</q> (implication and converse) of the proof is established by the tasks above.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First, suppose a connected graph <m>G</m> has an Euler path.  If this path is an Euler circuit, we are done, since there will be no odd degree vertices.  Otherwise, by part (a), we can form a new graph <m>G'</m> that has an Euler circuit, and by <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, this <m>G'</m> must have all vertices of even degree.  But part (a) tells us then that <m>G</m> will have exactly two odd degree vertices.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose <m>G</m> has at most two odd degree vertices.  If all vertices are even, then we are done by <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>.  There are no graphs with exactly one odd degree vertex.  So assume that <m>G</m> has exactly two odd degree vertices.  By part (b), we can build a graph <m>G'</m> that has all even degree vertices, which must therefore have an Euler circuit.  But this Euler circuit becomes an Euler path when you look back at <m>G</m>, as required.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
  </activity>

  <p>
    Good, so we only need to prove <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>.

        Which of the two implications will be easier to prove?  State both implications and say specifically what it would take to prove each.  Say what would be required both for doing a direct proof and a proof by contrapositive.

  <activity>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you had a graph and were given an Euler circuit for that graph.  How might you represent that Euler circuit?  If you listed each edge in order, where each edge was given as a pair of vertices, how many times would each vertex appear in the list?  What have you just shown?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Suppose a graph has an Euler circuit, written <m>(v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)</m>.  Since it is a circuit, we have <m>v_0 = v_n</m>.  Consider the edges used in this path.  They are <m>\{v_0, v_1\}</m>, <m>\{v_1, v_2\}</m>, and so on up to <m>\{v_{n-1}, v_n\}</m>.  Every time a vertex appears in the walk, it is part of two edges, except for <m>v_0</m> and <m>v_n</m>.  But these are the same vertex, so taken together, these constitute two edges as well.  Since every edges is used in an Euler circuit, we see that every vertex must have even degree.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simpler way to say all of this: in the Euler circuit, a vertex appearing <m>k</m> times must have degree <m>2k</m>, except for the starting and ending vertex, which will have degree <m>2k</m> if it appears <m>k+1</m> times.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </activity>

  <p>
    The other direction is harder.  If you know every vertex has even degree, you must now show there is an Euler circuit.  One thing you could do is to give a procedure for building one.  But then you must prove that this procedure is correct.  We will come back to this question when we look at mathematical induction.

<title>Hamilton Paths</title>
<p>
Suppose you wanted to tour Königsberg in such a way where you visit each land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a <term>Hamilton path</term> (or <term>Hamiltonian path</term>)<idx><h>Hamilton path</h></idx>.  We could also consider <term>Hamilton cycles</term>, which are Hamilton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.

    The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path.  You would need to visit each of the <q>outside</q> vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get stuck.  Note that this graph does not have an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no Hamilton paths.
  </p>

</solution>
</example>



<p>
It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check whether there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete<idx><h>NP-complete</h></idx>.

  While a complete classification for which graphs have Hamilton paths is hard, there are some simpler things we can say.  The following is one example.

              Suppose the graph did have a Hamilton cycle, say <m>(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, a_k, b_k, a_1)</m>.  Here we are writing vertices as <m>a_i</m> if they are in the <m>A</m> part of the bipartite graph, and <m>b_i</m> if they are in the <m>B</m> part.  Since there are no edges between vertices in the same part, we know that the cycle must alternate between <m>A</m> vertices and <m>B</m> vertices, before finally returning to the starting <m>A</m> vertex <m>a_1</m>.  In particular, this says that there must be an equal number of vertices in the <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> parts.  But the graph in question does not have this.

              A simpler way of saying this is that the graph above has 11 vertices, so any Hamliton cycle must include 11 edges.  But since the graph is bipartite, there are no odd length cycles at all.

              We can prove the contrapositive.  Suppose <m>G</m> has a Hamilton path <m>(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, v)</m>.  Since <m>G</m> is bipartite, we know that <m>a_i \in A</m> and <m>b_i \in B</m> form a bipartition of the vertices.  The last vertex in the path is either in <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>.  If <m>v \in B</m>, then <m>\card{A} = \card{B}</m>.  If <m>v \in A</m>, then <m>\card{A} = \card{B} + 1</m>.  But in either case, we see that neither part has at least two more vertices than the other.
