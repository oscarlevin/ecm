          Suppose you have two number cubes with non-standard labels.  The first has 1's on four sides and 2's on the remaining two sides, while the second cube has two 1's and four 2's. You will roll the pair of dice and compute the sum of the numbers rolled.

            How many ways could you roll a 2?  What about a 3?  4?  You should be able to answer these questions by making a <m>6\times 6</m> addition table (with a lot of repeated row and column headers), but make sure you also think about how the sum and product principles are being used.

          A standard problem to use when introducing probability is to ask for the probability of rolling a particular sum on two regular number cubes (dice numbered 1 through 6).  Students might not immediately see that some sums are more likely to occur than others.  You can illustrate this by creating a table.

          It is also possible to multiply infinite polynomials (i.e., power series).  As long as we are only interested in the first few terms, we can find these by multiplying a small number of terms from the two infinite polynomials.  Multiply the following series out through at least <m>x^7</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title>Visualizing Counting with Pictures</title>
      <p>Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as
      <me>
          \ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
          +\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
      </me>
      Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus <m>\ap</m> stands for taking an apple, <m>\ap\pe</m> for taking an apple and a pear, and <m>\ap\ap</m> for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the <q>exclusive or,</q> that is, <m>\ap+\ba</m> would stand for <q>I take an apple or a banana but not both.</q> To say <q>I take both an apple and a banana,</q> we would write <m>\ap\ba</m>. We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to
      <me>
          \ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
          \ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
      </me>
      </p>

      <p>In this notation <m>\ap^3</m> stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while <m>\ap^2\ba</m> stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set <m>\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}</m>.<fn>This approach was inspired by George P&#xf3;lya's paper <q>Picture Writing,</q> in the December, 1956 issue of the <pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle>, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than P&#xf3;lya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.</fn>
      </p>

      <p>Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as
      <mdn>
          <mrow number="no">

We interpret <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret <xref ref="threefruitsagain">Formula</xref> as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.

      <title>Picture functions</title>
      <p>As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent<fn>We are really adapting language introduced by George P&#xf3;lya.</fn> some. By a <term>picture</term> of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture <m>P(s)</m> to each member <m>s</m> of a set <m>S</m> will be called a <term>picture function</term> . The <term>picture enumerator</term><idx><h>picture enumerator</h></idx> for a picture function <m>P</m> defined on a set <m>S</m> will be
      <me>
          E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
      </me>
      </p>

      <p>We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of <m>S</m> according to their pictures. Thus <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.

        </example>  
          
        <p>  
          Generating functions for infinite sequences are examples of power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.<fn>In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology <q>generating function</q> may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.</fn> Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of <m>y+1</m> for <m>x</m> in the power series <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i</m>, because in order to interpret <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i</m> as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the <m>(y+1)^i</m> terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of <m>y^0</m>, and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any<nbsp /><m>y^i</m>. (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute <m>y+y^2</m> for <m>x</m>. Can you see why?)

      <title>Product principle for generating functions</title>
      <!-- TODO: Perhaps just ax this section entirely.  Or just point out the amazing fact the multiplication does the right thing. -->
      <p>
        Each time that we converted a picture function to a generating function by substituting <m>x</m> or some power of <m>x</m> for each picture, the coefficient of <m>x</m> had a meaning that was significant to us. For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted <m>x</m> for each of our pictures, the exponent <m>i</m> in the power <m>x^i</m> is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to <m>x^i</m>. After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of <m>x</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> is the number of fruit selections that use <m>i</m> pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute <m>x^c</m> for a picture, where <m>c</m> is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the <m>i</m> in an <m>x^i</m> term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to <m>x^i</m>, and the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with <m>i</m> calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.

And since values cannot be negative, the only <m>i</m>s available to us are the ones between <m>0</m> and <m>k</m>. By the product principle for pairs, the number of ordered pairs <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>v_1(x)=i</m> and <m>v_2(y)=k-i</m> is <m>a_ib_{k-i}</m>. To get the number of pairs of total value <m>k</m>, we have to sum over all possible pairs <m>(i,k-i)</m> of values, that is, we have to take the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^k a_ib_{k-i}</m>.

      The generating functions you found in the previous section all can be expressed in terms of the reciprocal of a quadratic polynomial. However without a power series representation, the generating function doesn't tell us what the sequence is. It turns out that whenever you can factor a polynomial into linear factors (and over the complex numbers such a factorization always exists) you can use that factorization to express the reciprocal in terms of power series.

            <mrow>y \amp= -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{1\cdot3\cdot5\cdots(2i-3)}{i!}(-1)^{2i-1}2^ix^{i-1}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=  \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(2i-2)!}{(i-1)!2^{i}i!}2^ix^{i-1}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp=  \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{2i-2!}{i!(i-1)!}x^{i-1}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp= \sum_{j=0}^\infty\frac{2j!}{(j+1)!j!}x^j</mrow>
          </md>
          giving us <m>C_j=\frac{1}{j+1}\binom{2j}{j}</m>, which is our earlier formula for the
          Catalan Number <m>C_j</m>.
