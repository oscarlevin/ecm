<title>Partitions of Integers</title>
  <introduction>
    <!-- <p>
      The very interesting history of the theory of linear partitions dates back to the Middle Ages, where certain special problems in partitions were encountered.  The first major discoveries were made by L. Euler in the 18th century, followed by contributions by Cayley, Gauss, Hardy, Jacobi, Lagrange, Legendre, Littlewoood, Rademacher, Ramanujan, Schur, and Sylvester.

        In <xref ref="compositionagian"/>, we counted the <em>compositions</em> of an integer <m>n</m>, by counting the number of solutions to the equation <m>x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n</m> where each <m>x_i</m> is a positive integer.  Put another way, we asked how many <em>lists</em> of <m>k</m> positive integers have sum <m>n</m>.  The order in which we listed the sum mattered.  What if it didn't?

      <p>
        A multiset of positive integers that add to <m>n</m> is called a <term>partition</term><idx><h>partition of an integer</h></idx> of <m>n</m>. Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of <m>k</m> is denoted by the <term>partition number</term> <m>p(k)</m>; in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that <m>p(3) = 3</m>. It is traditional to use Greek letters like <m>\lambda</m> to stand for partitions; we might write <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, <m>\gamma= 2,1</m> and <m>\tau = 3</m> to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write <m>\lambda = 1^3</m> as a shorthand for <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, and we write <m>\lambda \dashv 3</m> as a shorthand for <q><m>\lambda</m> is a partition of three.</q>
      </p>

      <example>
        There are 5 partitions of 4 (so <m>p(4) = 5</m>).  They are <m>4=1+1+1+1</m>, <m>4=2+1+1</m>, <m>4=2+2</m>, <m>4=3+1</m>, and <m>4=4</m>.
      </example>

        A <term>partition of the integer <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts</term><idx><h>partition of an integer</h><h>into <m>n</m> parts</h></idx> is a multiset of <m>n</m> positive integers that add to <m>k</m>. We use <m>p_n(k)</m> to denote the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts. Thus <m>p_n(k)</m> is the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> identical objects to <m>n</m> identical recipients so that each gets at least one.
      </p>
      
      <example>
        <p>
          Here are the partitions of 7 into two parts: <m>6+1</m>, <m>5+2</m>, <m>4+3</m>.  Thus <m>p_2(7) = 3</m>.

            How many compositions are there of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts? What is the maximum number of compositions that could correspond to a given partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts?

        <solution>
          <p>
            The number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts is <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. We can divide the compositions into blocks, where two compositions are in the same block if and only if one is a rearrangement of the other. Then the blocks correspond bijectively to partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts. However we cannot compute the number of blocks by dividing by the number of compositions per block since the number of compositions per block ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n!</m>.  But then if we divide the number of compositions by <m>n!</m> we will get a number less than the number of blocks because <m>n!</m> times the number of blocks would be, by the sum principle, greater than the number of partitions.

Such a representation of a partition is called a <term>type vector</term> representation of a partition, and it is typical to leave the trailing zeros out of such a representation; for example <m>(2,1)</m> stands for the same partition as <m>(2,1,0,0)</m>.

              The type vector of a partition of <m>k</m> is a way of
              representing the multiplicity function of the multiset of integers
              that adds to <m>k</m>. Thus there is a bijection between type vectors and

              They are equal, because if we take two different partitions
              of <m>k-1</m> and increase the multiplicity of 1 in each (by one), they are
              still different; also if we take two different partitions of <m>k</m> that
              have parts of size one, and decrease the multiplicity of 1 in each (by
              one), they are still different.

      <p>
        When we write a partition as <m>\lambda = \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>, it is customary to write the list of <m>\lambda_i</m>s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector <m>(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)</m> for a partition, we write either <m>\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}</m> or <m>\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}</m>. Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write <m>\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}</m>, we will assume that <m>\lambda_i>\lambda_i+1</m>.

      <p>
        It is remarkable that there is no known formula for <m>p_n(k)</m>, nor is there one for <m>p(k)</m>. We have computed a few values of <m>p_n(k)</m> by listing partitions.  If we continue to do so, we could build a triangle of partition numbers as follows.

          So for example, <m>p_3(7) = 4</m>: <m>(5,1,1)</m>, <m>(4,2,1)</m>, <m>(3,3,1)</m>, and <m>(3,2,2)</m>.  It sure would be nice to find the next row without having to list out all the partitions.  Perhaps we could use some sort of recursion!
        </p>

      
      <p>
        With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set <m>S</m> of numbers if we remove the largest element of <m>S</m>. Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we will be able to <q>see</q> how to get smaller partitions from larger.

        The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list <m>(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)</m>, we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has <m>\lambda_1</m> equally spaced dots in the first row, <m>\lambda_2</m> equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge.

At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.

        The natural way to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of <m>n</m> is to remove some of the squares from the Young diagram.  We lots of choices here. 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We could remove the entire top row.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We could remove the entire left-most column.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We could remove a single box somewhere. But from where?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Removing the top row corresponds to removing the largest part of the partition.  Removing the left-most column corresponds to subtracting 1 from each part.  Removing a single box will reduce one part by 1.  Some of these might be more useful than others.

            Suppose we wanted to compute <m>p_5(13)</m>.  Since we have the 8th row of the partition number triangle, we should be able to do this with the long recursion.  What if we wanted to use the short recursion?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Use the short recursion to compute <m>p_5(13)</m>.  If you get a partition number that you don't yet know, use the short recursion to compute that as well (you know, the way you use recursions).

        </statement>
      </activity>
      
      <p>
        As you see above, the short recursion is nothing more than grouping all but the first term in the sum into a single partition number, using the long recursion again.  This should make sense based on the geometry of the Young digrams.

            <p>Take the top row and left

            new diagram. (Only include the square that is in both the row and column
            once.) Now take the remaining squares in the next row and column and make
            a new row of the Young diagram of the second partition with them.
            Continue this process with succeeding rows and columns, not using any
            squares you have already used. Because the first partition is self
            conjugate, the diagram has the same number of rows as columns and row
            <m>i</m> and column
            <m>i</m> have the same length. Because row <m>i</m> and column <m>i</m> share one
            square, and we only use that square once when we create a new row, each row
            we create has odd length. Thus we get a partition with the same number of
            squares, so it is a partition of <m>k</m> and each part is odd. The parts are
            distinct because when we take off the squares of a row and column, we
            reduce the number of squares in each row and column that remains. Given
            a partition of <m>k</m> into distinct odd parts, we use the fact that each
            row has a unique middle element, and each is shorter than the one
            above (by at least two squares) to reverse the process. Thus we have a
            bijection.

            The number of partitions of <m>k</m> into even parts equals the
            number of partitions of parts of even multiplicity, because if we take
            the Young diagram of a partition of <m>k</m> into even parts and conjugate
            it, the resulting diagram has columns of even length. Thus the
            difference in heights of two successive columns is an even number,
            but this difference is the multiplicity of one of the parts of the
            conjugate. Further the height of the last column of a partition is
            the multiplicity of the first part. Since the multiplicity of any part
            of a partition is either the difference in height of two successive
            columns of the Young diagram or the height of the last column, then
            each part of the conjugate has even multiplicity. This bijection can
            be reversed, because if all the differences in height of the columns are
            even and the height of the last column is even, then when we
            conjugate this partition, the last row will be an even length, and
            all differences in length of the rows will be even, so all the parts
            of the resulting partition will be even.

            The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation.

Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is <m>m</m> or more units wide (horizontally) and <m>n</m> or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an <m>m'</m> unit wide and <m>n'</m> unit deep rectangle with <m>m'\ge m</m> and <m>n' \ge n</m>, as in <xref ref="complementpartition" />.

                If we fill the rectangle with unit squares, those not in the Young diagram of the original partition <m>\lambda</m> will fall into rows.  The lengths of the rows are nonnegative, and are nondecreasing as we move down. Therefore, after we rotate through 180 degrees, these same rows will be listed in the opposite order, lined up along the left sides, and will have nonincreasing length. Thus they will be the Young diagram of a partition.

          <p>
        To deal with an odd number of repetitions of the complementation
        process, think of it as an even number plus 1. Thus ask what kind of

        complementation process.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Let us call the process of enclosing <m>\lambda</m> in the smallest rectangle possible and then forming the complement in that rectangle <term>encomplementation</term> (This is short for <em>en</em>\/closure and <em>complementation</em> and is not a standard term<mdash />there is no standard term for this operation.) and call the result of it the <term>encomplement</term><idx><h>encomplement of a partition</h></idx> of <m>\lambda</m>.  The result of two encomplementations on the Young diagram of a partition is to remove all rows of maximum length and all columns of maximum length from the Young diagram. Thus the description of the result of an even number <m>2j</m> of encomplementations is straightforward; we remove all the rows of the <m>j</m> largest distinct lengths and all columns of the <m>j</m> largest distinct lengths. So if an even number of encomplementations brings us to a partition with one block of size one, we should be able to describe the original partition fairly easily. To deal with the result of an odd number of encomplementations, we ask what happens if we encomplement just once.  If the complement of <m>\lambda</m> in the smallest rectangle in which if fits has one square, then <m>\lambda =\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_1-1</m>. Thus we are asking for the partitions which, after an even number of encomplementations, give us either the partition with one block or a partition of the form <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m>. First we ask what kind of partition results in the second one after two encomplementations. If we get <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> from two encomplementations, the partition we started with had the form
            <me>
              \lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+\lambda_{2})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+
              \lambda_2-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            If we get <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> from four encomplementations, then we started with a partition of the form
            <me>
              \lambda_{-1}^{n_{-1}}(\lambda_0+\lambda_{3})^{n_0}(\lambda_1+
              \lambda_2 +
              \lambda_{3})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+\lambda_2 +\lambda_3-1)(\lambda_2+
              \lambda_{3})^{n_3}
              \lambda_3^{n_3}.
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            From this pattern we see that a partition that results in <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> after <m>2j</m> encomplementations has the form
            <men xml:id="form1" >
              \lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
              \lambda_0^{n_0}
              {\lambda'_1}^{n_1}
              (\lambda'_1-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
              \lambda_{j+1}^{n_{j+1}},
            </men>
            where <m>\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}</m> and <m>\lambda_0>\lambda'_1>\lambda_2+1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, a partition <m>\lambda</m> that results in <m>1</m> after two encomplementations has the form <m>\lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}</m>, and so a partition that results in 1 after <m>j</m> encomplementations is of the form
            <men xml:id="form2" >
              \lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
              \lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
              \lambda_j^{n_j},
            </men>
            where <m>\lambda_i>\lambda_{i+1}</m> and <m>\lambda_0>\lambda_1+1</m>. Thus a partition results in a single part of size 1 after some number of encomplementations if and only if it has the form of <xref ref="form1">Equation</xref> or <xref ref="form2">Equation</xref>.

Now partition <m>k</m> into <m>2^{k_1}</m> parts of size <m>\gamma_1</m>, <m>2^{k_2}</m> parts of size <m>\gamma_2</m>, etc. and you have a partition of <m>k</m> into odd parts.

        <p>We start by giving a function from the set of partitions of <m>k</m> to the set of partitions of <m>k</m> with (only) odd parts. Clearly such a function cannot be one to one. Then we show that when restricted to the partitions with distinct parts it is one-to-one and onto by constructing an inverse. Given a partition <m>\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}</m>, write <m>\lambda_i=\gamma_i2^{k_i}</m>, where <m>\gamma_i</m> is odd. (Thus <m>2^{k_i}</m> is the highest power of 2 that is a factor of <m>\lambda_i</m>, so it is 1 if <m>\lambda_i</m> is odd.). It is possible that <m>\gamma_i=\gamma_j</m>, for example if <m>\lambda_i=36</m> and <m>\lambda_j=18</m>, then <m>\gamma_i=\gamma_j=9</m>. We construct a new partition <m>\pi</m> whose parts are the numbers <m>\gamma_j</m> as follows: Given an odd number <m>p</m>, let the multiplicity <m>m(p)</m> of <m>p</m> in <m>\pi</m> be <m>\sum_{j: \gamma_j=m} 2^{k_j}</m>. Thus <m>\sum_{p: m(p)\not=0}m(p)p = k</m>. Therefore, <m>\pi</m> is a partition of <m>k</m> whose parts are all odd.
        </p>

        <p>Now consider a partition <m>\pi</m> of <m>k</m> whose parts are all odd. Let <m>\pi=\pi_1^{r_1}\pi_2^{r_2}\cdots \pi_t^{r_t}</m>, with <m>\pi_i>\pi_{i+1}</m>. (In terms of the multiplicity function <m>m</m>, <m>m(\pi_i) =r_i</m>, and <m>\sum_{i=1}^t r_i\pi_i = k</m>.) We are going to write the binary expansion of each <m>r_i</m> as <m>r_i = \sum_{j= 0}^{\lfloor \log_2 r_i\rfloor} 2^{ja_{ij}}</m>, where <m>a_{ij}</m> is 1 if <m>2^j</m> appears in the binary expansion of <m>r_i</m>, and 0 otherwise. All of the numbers <m>\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}</m> are distinct, because a power of two times one odd number cannot equal a power of two times another odd number. The numbers <m>\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}</m> add to <m>k</m>, so they are the parts of a partition <m>\pi'</m> of <m>k</m> into distinct parts. When we apply the function constructed in the first part of the solution to <m>\pi'</m>, we get <m>\pi</m>, so the correspondence between <m>\pi</m> and <m>\pi'</m> is a bijection.

          Suppose we have a partition of <m>k</m> into distinct parts. If the smallest part, say <m>m</m>, is smaller than the number of parts, we may add one to each of the <m>m</m> largest parts and delete the smallest part, and we have changed the parity of the number of parts, but we still have distinct parts. On the other hand, suppose the smallest part, again say <m>m</m>, is larger than or equal to the number of parts. Then we can subtract 1 from each part larger than <m>m</m>, and add a part equal to the number of parts larger than <m>m</m>. This changes the parity of the number of parts, but if the second smallest part is <m>m+1</m>, the resulting partition does not have distinct parts. Thus this method does not work. Further, if it did always work, the case <m>k \ne \frac{3j^2+j}{2}</m> would be covered also. However you can modify this method by comparing <m>m</m> not to the total number of parts, but to the number of rows at the top of the Young diagram that differ by exactly one from the row above. Even in this situation, there are certain slight additional assumptions you need to make, so this hint leaves you a lot of work to do. (It is reasonable to expect problems because of that exceptional case.) However, it should lead you in a useful direction.

Tomescu calls a collection of rows in a Young diagram a <q>trapezoid</q> if each row contains one less cell than the row above and the number of cells in the rows above and below the trapezoid differ by two or more from the number of cells in rows of the trapezoid. Thus in (8,6,5,4,2,1) we have 3 trapezoids, the first row, the next three rows, and the last two. Since we are dealing with partitions with distinct parts, we don't have to worry about how two equal rows affect the definition of a trapezoid. We will describe a way to transform a partition with an even number of distinct parts into a partition with an odd number of distinct parts and vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>
          First we describe a transformation on Young diagrams. Here is the first part of the description. Suppose the smallest part <m>m</m> of <m>\lambda</m> is less than or equal to the number <m>j</m> of rows in the top trapezoid. Suppose further that if we have only one trapezoid, then <m>j>m</m>. Then we construct a partition with one less part by adding 1 to each of the <m>m</m> largest parts and discarding the part <m>m</m>. We still have a diagram for a partition of the same integer, but now the parity of the number of parts has changed, and we <em>may</em> have increased the number of trapezoids by 1. The smallest part will now be larger than the number (now <m>m</m>) of rows in the top trapezoid. (Notice that the construction would not work if we had only one trapezoid and <m>j=m</m> because we would first remove one row of the trapezoid and thus have no row to which to attach one of our squares.)
        </p>

        <p>Here is the second part of the description of the transformation. Suppose now that <m>m</m> is larger than the number <m>j</m> of rows of the top trapezoid in the Young diagram. Suppose also that the Young diagram has at least two trapezoids or it has one trapezoid and <m>j\ge m-2</m>. Take one square from each of the <m>j</m> rows of the top trapezoid (which is the whole diagram if there is only one trapezoid) and also add a row of <m>j</m> squares at the bottom of the diagram. (Since <m>m>j</m>, this gives us a Young diagram of a partition of the same integer into distinct parts.) The parity of the number of rows has changed, and now the number of rows of the top trapezoid is at least as large as the smallest part of the partition. (Note, two previously distinct trapezoids may have joined together to form one on top.)  (Notice that if we have one trapezoid and <m>j= m+1</m>, then the construction yields a partition with two equal parts, which is why we made the special assumption above.) Now let <m>T</m> be the transformation described by the two constructions above. Its domain is all Young diagrams except those with one trapezoid and <m>m\le j\le m+1</m>. <m>T^2</m> is the identity, and so <m>T</m> is a bijection.  When restricted to partitions with an odd number of parts, <m>T</m> gives partitions with an even number of parts, so on its domain it gives a bijection between partitions with an even number of parts and partitions with an odd number of parts.
        </p>

        <p>If <m>m=j</m> and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has <m>\frac{3j^2-j}{2}</m> squares, and if <m>m=j+1</m> and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has <m>\frac{3j^2+j}{2}</m> squares. Thus if <m>k\ne \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m>, the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into distinct even parts equals the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into distinct odd parts.
        </p>

        <p>If <m>k= \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m> and <m>j</m> is even, then there is one diagram of a partition of <m>k</m> that is not in the domain of the bijection and has an even number of rows, so in this case there will be one more partition with an even number of parts than with an odd number. If <m>k= \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m> and <m>j</m> is odd, there is one diagram with an odd number of rows not in the domain and so in this case there is one more partition with an odd number of parts than with an even number. This completes the exceptional cases of the problem.

      How does the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts compare to the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts (not necessarily distinct)?
      What do compositions have to do with partitions?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts is <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. Divide the compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts into blocks with two compositions in the same block if one is a rearrangement of the other. Because the parts are distinct, each block has <m>n!</m> members. Further, there is a bijection between the blocks of this partition and the partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts. Since the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>, the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\frac{1}{n!}  \binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>.

  <title>Using Generating Functions</title>
  
  <p>
    I this final section we will see that generating functions are especially well suited for the study of integer partitions.  We will start with a classic example.
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="change-making" category="essential">
      <statement>
          <p>If we have five identical pennies, five identical nickels, five identical dimes, and five identical quarters, give the picture enumerator for the combinations of coins we can form and convert it to a generating function for the number of ways to make <m>k</m> cents with the coins we have. Do the same thing assuming we have an unlimited supply of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.
          </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
          <p>
              This is a good place to apply the product principle for picture enumerators.  Don't be afraid to use technology to finish the problem.
          </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
          <p>
              <m>(1+P+P^2+P^3+P^4+P^5)(1+N+N^2+N^3+N^4+N^5)(1+D+D^2+D^3+D^4+D^5)
              (1+Q+Q^2+Q^3+Q^4+Q^5)</m>. Substituting <m>x</m> for <m>P</m>, <m>x^5</m> for <m>N</m>, <m>x^{10}</m> for
              <m>D</m> and <m>x^{25}</m> for <m>Q</m> gives us
              <me>
                  \sum_{i=0}^5x^i\sum_{i=0}^5x^{5i}\sum_{i=0}^5 x^{10i} \sum_{i=0}^5
                  x^{25i}=\frac{1-x^6}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1-x^{30}}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1-x^{60}}{
                  1-x^{10}}\cdot \frac{1-x^{150}}{1-x^{25}}.
              </me>
          </p>

          <p>Although we could write this as a polynomial times a product of four power series, doing so would not significantly increase our understanding, though it would let us make some painful computations of the number of ways to make a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted such numbers we would be better off asking a computer algebra package to expand the product of the polynomials on the left. With unlimited supplies the generating function becomes
          <me>
              \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{10}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{25}}.
          </me>
          </p>

          <p>Again, we could write this as a product of power series, and that would allow us to painfully compute the number of ways to create a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted to know the number of ways to make up 200 cents, say, it would be more sensible to ask a computer algebra package to extract the coefficient of <m>x^{200}</m> in the product of the four quotients.

          <p>
              Conjugation is a bijection between partitions with largest part at most <m>m</m> and partitions with at most <m>m</m> parts. Thus the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> into parts of size at most <m>m</m>) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m> will be the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> with at most <m>m</m> parts) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m>. Thus the two generating functions are the same.

                \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
                \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +x^i +x^{2i} +\cdots + x^{i^2}.
            </me>
            </p>

            <p>However, one makes sense and one doesn't. Figure out which one makes sense and explain why it makes sense and the other one doesn't. If we want a product of the form
            <me>
                \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x),
            </me>
            where each <m>p_i(x)</m> is a nonzero polynomial in <m>x</m> to make sense, describe a relatively simple assumption about the polynomials <m>p_i(x)</m> that will make the product make sense. If we assumed the terms <m>p_i(x)</m> were nonzero power series, is there a relatively simple assumption we could make about them in order to make the product make sense? (Describe such a condition or explain why you think there couldn't be one.)
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
If infinitely many of the polynomials had a nonzero coefficient for <m>q</m>, would the product make any sense?
            </p>
        </hint>

        <solution>
            <p>
                <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +x^i +x^{2i} +\cdots + x^{i^2}</m> makes sense because when we look for ways of choosing one summand from each factor so that the summands multiply together to give us <m>x^k</m>, we will find only finitely many ways of making those choices, so the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> can be taken to be the number of such choices. On the other hand, in the expression <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i</m>, there are infinitely many ways to choose <m>x</m> from one term and <m>1</m> from all the rest of the terms so that the product of these summands is <m>x</m>. Thus we can't even specify what the coefficient of <m>x</m> is in the product. On the basis of this analysis, we see that for <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x)</m> to make sense, we need to assume that for each possible positive integer <m>n</m>, there are only a finite number of polynomials <m>p_i</m> whose lowest degree term has degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>. In that way, for each positive integer, there will be only finitely many ways to chose a summand from each factor so that the product of the summands is a multiple of <m>x^k</m>. The same assumption works when the <m>p_i</m> are power series, for the same reason.

          Finally, multiply instead by <m>x^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}} = x^6</m> (when <m>m = 3</m>) to get <m>x^6 + x^7 + 2x^8 + 3x^9+ 4x^{10} + \cdots</m>.

In this problem we will give the generating function for the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into at most <m>n</m> parts, the largest of which is at most <m>m</m>. That is we will analyze <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_kx^k</m> where <m>a_k</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into at most <m>n</m> parts, the largest of which is at most <m>m</m>. Geometrically, it is the generating function for partitions whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle, as in <xref ref="rectanglecomplement"/>. This generating function has significant analogs to the binomial coefficient <m>\binom{m+n}{n}</m>, and so it is denoted by <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m>. It is called a <term><m>q</m>-binomial coefficient</term>.<idx><h><m>q</m>-binomial coefficient</h></idx><idx><h>binomial coefficient</h><h><m>q</m>-binomial</h></idx>

                    We want to calculate the number of partitions whose Young diagrams fit into a two by two square. These partitions have at most two parts and the parts have size at most two. Thus they are partitions of 1, 2, 3, or 4. However not all partitions of 3 or 4 have diagrams that fit into a two by two square. Try writing down the relevant diagrams.

            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    A partition with up to two parts of size up to two can have no parts, one part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 1, one part of size 2 which makes it a partition of 2, two parts of size 1, which makes it a partition of 2, a part of size 2 and a part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 3, or two parts of size 2, which makes it a partition of 4. Thus <m>\qchoose{4}{2}=1+x+2x^2+x^3+x^4</m>.

                        The largest part of a partition counted by <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is either <m>m</m> or is less than or equal to <m>m-1</m>.  In the second case, the partition fits into a rectangle that is at most <m>m-1</m> units wide and at most <m>n</m> units deep.  What is the generating function for partitions of this type?  In the first case, what kind of rectangle does the partition we get by removing the largest part sit in?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle after we remove a largest part of size <m>m</m>?  What recurrence relation does this give you?
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>The generating function for partitions that arise in the second case is <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}=\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}</m>. In the first case, after we delete the largest part, the Young diagram sits in a rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n-1</m>. The generating function for partitions that arise in the first case <em>after</em> we have deleted a part of size <m>m</m> is <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus the generating function for partitions that arise in the first case (<em>before</em> we delete the part of size <m>m</m>) is <m>x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus by the sum principle the generating function for all partitions that fit into a rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n</m> is given by
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}= x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}+\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}.
                    </me>
                    </p>

                    <p>If you don't use the symmetry <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}=\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}</m>, you get
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}= x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}+\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}.

                    <p>
                        While this doesn't <em>quite</em> look like the Pascal recurrence, it is still a correct answer.

                    <p>We either have exactly <m>k</m> parts or fewer than <m>k</m> parts. In the first case, removing one from each part gives us a partition whose Young diagram fits into a <m>m-1</m> by <m>n</m> box, while in the second case doing nothing gives us a partition that fits into a <m>m</m> by <m>n-1</m> box. In the first case the partition we get partitions <m>k-n</m>, and in the second case it still partitions <m>k</m>. Thus we get

                    Since the generating function is a finite sum (we are talking about partitions whose Young diagram into a finite rectangle), the limit is obtained by setting <m>q=1</m>, and this sums the number of partitions of each possible number <m>k</m> that have at most <m>n</m> parts all of size at most <m>m</m>. We want a bijection between such partitions and the <m>n</m> element subsets of an <m>m+n</m> element set. Recall that there is a bijection between subsets of an <m>n</m> element set and lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>m,n</m> in a coordinate plane. If we draw our rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n</m> with its lower left corner at <m>(0,0)</m>, then each Young diagram gives us such a lattice path and each such lattice path gives us a Young diagram.

                <p><m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is the generating function for the number of partitions whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. That is,
                <me>
                    \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k,

                where <m>a_k</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k</m> whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. In particular <m>a_k=0</m> if <m>k>mn</m>, because the Young diagram of a partition of a number larger than <m>mn</m> certainly cannot fit into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. Thus
                <me>
                    \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{mn} a_kx^k.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, <m>a_k=a_{mn-k}</m>, because the complement in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle of a partition of <m>k</m> is a partition of <m>mn-k</m>, and complementation in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle is a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> that fit into the rectangle and partitions of <m>mn-k</m> that fit into the rectangle. Thus <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>mn</m> in which the coefficient of <m>q_k</m> equals the coefficient of <m>x^{mn-k}</m>. For this reason we can compute the limit as <m>q</m> approaches <m>-1</m> simply by substituting <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> in the polynomial; the only trouble being that the formula we know for <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is quotient of polynomials that has zero in both the numerator and denominator when we substitute in <m>q=-1</m>. Nonetheless, when we substitute <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> we get the alternating sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>.  Thus if <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite sign, they will cancel out. If <m>mn</m> is even, <m>i</m> is even exactly when <m>mn-i</m> is even, and so <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have the same sign. However when <m>mn</m> is odd, <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite signs in the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>, and so the sum is zero.  Thus the polynomial <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is zero at <m>q=-1</m> whenever <m>mn</m> is odd.
                </p>

                <p>Our experience with binomial coefficients might lead us to hope that the alternating sum of the coefficients <m>a_k</m> will always be zero. However, we computed that <m>\qchoose{4}{2}=1+x+2x^2+x^3+x^4</m>, so
                <me>
                    \lim_{q\rightarrow -1}\qchoose{4}{2}=1-1+2-1+1=1.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>We could compute some more values of the limit by going back to the definition in this way, but it seems unlikely that we could get enough data to make a good conjecture. However we have the recurrence, and setting <m>q=-1</m> in the recurrence gives us <xref ref="q-binomial-tab" />.  From the table, it is clear that we get binomial coefficients interspersed with 0s in the even numbered rows of our table and repeated binomial coefficients in the odd numbered rows of our table. In particular when <m>m+n</m> and <m>n</m> are both even, <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=\binom{(m+n)/2}{n/2}</m>, and if <m>m+n</m> is even and <m>n</m> is odd, <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=0</m>. In our table, at least, if <m>m+n</m> is odd, it appears that we get <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=\binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}</m>. In fact, using the recurrence just as we used it to construct the table, we can prove by induction that
                <me>
                    \negchoose{m+n}{n}=\left\{
                    \begin{array}{ll}0\amp \mbox{if \(mn\) is odd} \\
                    \binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\amp \mbox{otherwise.}
                    \end{array} \right.
