<investigation>
<p>
Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty, they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use and still accomplish this task?

	    How many colors do you need to color the faces of a cube so that no two faces that share an edge are colored the same?  Is there a polyhedron that would require four colors to do this?  Is there a polyhedron that requires five?
	  </p>
	</statement>
</investigation>

<p>
Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.
</p>

<p>
How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.
</p>

<p>
In general, given any graph <m>G</m>, a coloring of the vertices with <m>k</m> colors is called a <term><m>k</m>-coloring</term><idx><h>vertex coloring</h></idx><idx><h><m>k</m>-coloring</h></idx>. If the coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called <term>proper</term>. Every graph has a proper <m>k</m>-coloring for some <m>k</m>. For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. 
The smallest <m>k</m> for which there is a proper <m>k</m>-coloring is called the <term>chromatic number</term><idx><h>chromatic number</h></idx> of the graph, written <m>\chi(G)</m><notation><usage>\chi(G)</usage><description>the chromatic number of <m>G</m></description></notation>.
</p>
<example>
<statement>
<p>
Find the chromatic number of the graphs below.

	  \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
	</image>
</sidebyside>

</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The graph on the left is <m>K_6</m>. The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.
</p>

<p>
The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:
</p>
<sidebyside width="25%">
	<image>
	<latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=.8]
	      \draw  (-1,0) \vb{R} -- (0,0) \vb{B} -- (1,0) \vb{G} -- (.5,1) \vr{R} -- (0,0) -- (-.5,1) \vl{G} -- (0,2) \va{B} -- (.5,1) -- (-.5,1) -- (-1,0);
	    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
	</image>
</sidebyside>
<p>
There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.
</p>

<p>
The graph on the right is just <m>K_{2,3}</m>. As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.
</p>
</solution>
</example>
<p>
It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get; the graph <m>K_n</m> has chromatic number <m>n</m>. So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map. But there is.
</p>

<p>
The key observation is that while it is true that for any number <m>n</m>, there is a graph with chromatic number <m>n</m>, only some graphs arrive as representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all <em>planar</em>!
</p>

<p>
So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph? The answer is the infamous Four Color Theorem.
</p>

<theorem>
<title>The Four Color Theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
<idx><h>Four Color Theorem</h></idx>
If <m>G</m> is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no <q>easy</q> known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check an <em>unavoidable set</em> of 633 <em>reducible configurations</em>. The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.
</p>

<p>
  Of course if every planar graph has chromatic number at most 4, then every graph has chromatic number no more than 6.  Proving this (even without using the 4 color theorem) is not very difficult, and this at least shows that the chromatic numbers for planar graphs is bounded.
</p>

<activity>
	<statement>
	  <p>
	    Prove that every planar graph can be properly vertex colored with 6 or fewer colors.  
	  </p>
	</statement>
	<hint>
	  <p>
	    You will want to use a proof by induction on the number of vertices.  Use the fact that every planar graph has at least one vertex of degree at most 5.
	  </p>
	</hint>
</activity>

<p>
  In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a proof of the Four Color Theorem.  It wasn't until 11 years later that Percy John Heawood found an error in the proof.  However, the failed proof did lead to a nice proof that every planar graph has chromatic number at most five.  The next activity walks you through that proof.
</p>

<activity>
	<introduction>
		<p>
		  We will prove the Five Color Theorem, that every planar graph has a proper vertex coloring using five (or fewer) colors.  We proceed by induction on the number of vertices.  So assume that <m>G</m> is a planar graph with <m>n</m> vertices, and all planar graphs with fewer vertices have a proper 5-coloring.  We will use <m>\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> as our set of colors.
		</p>
	</introduction>
	<task>
		<statement>
		  <p>
		    Let <m>v</m> be a vertex of degree five or less (why can we do this?).  Let <m>H</m> be the graph resulting from deleting <m>v</m> and all its incident edges.  What can you say about <m>H</m>?
		  </p>
		</statement>
	</task>
	<task>
		<statement>
		  <p>
		    Let <m>v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5</m> be the vertices adjacent to <m>v</m> in <m>G</m>.  Why is it okay to assume there really are five and further that these five vertices are colored distinctly from each other?
		  </p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
		  <p>
		    If not, what could we do with <m>v</m>?
		  </p>
		</hint>
	</task>
	<task>
		<statement>
		  <p>
		    Assume <m>v_1, \ldots, v_5</m> are drawn in the plane in clockwise order around <m>v</m>, and further that they are colored <m>1,2,3,4,5</m> respectively.  Now consider the induced subgraph <m>H_{1,3}</m> of <m>H</m> consiting of all vertices colored 1 and 3 (and their edges).  Why can we assume that there is a path from <m>v_1</m> to <m>v_3</m> contained in <m>H_{1,3}</m>?
		  </p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
		  <p>
		    If not, what would happen if we recolor <m>v_1</m> with color 3, and all its adjacent vertices in <m>H_{1,3}</m> with color 1 and so on?  That is, could we swap colors to free up color 1 for <m>v</m>?
		  </p>
		</hint>
	</task>
	<task>
		<statement>
		  <p>
		    Now consider <m>H_{2,4}</m>, the induced subgraph of <m>H</m> of vertices colored 2 and 4.  Explain why their cannot be a path connecting <m>v_2</m> and <m>v_4</m>, and why this completes the proof.
		  </p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
		  <p>
		    Remember where <m>v_2</m> and <m>v_4</m> are relative to the path connecting <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_3</m>.
		  </p>
		</hint>
	</task>
</activity>

<p>
  You will notice that the proof above doesn't ever use <m>v_5</m>, so it is tempting to apply this same technique towards a proof of the four color theorem.  See if you can find the error in doing so in fewer than 11 years.

Radio stations broadcast their signal at certain frequencies. However, there are a limited number of frequencies to choose from, so nationwide many stations use the same frequency. This works because the stations are far enough apart that their signals will not interfere; no one radio could pick them up at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Suppose 10 new radio stations are to be set up in a currently unpopulated (by radio stations) region. The radio stations that are close enough to each other to cause interference are recorded in the table below. What is the fewest number of frequencies the stations could use.

Represent the problem as a graph with vertices as the stations and edges when two stations are close enough to cause interference. We are looking for the chromatic number of the graph. Vertices that are colored identically represent stations that can have the same frequency.

This graph has chromatic number 5. A proper 5-coloring is shown on the right. Notice that the graph contains a copy of the complete graph <m>K_5</m> so no fewer than 5 colors can be used.

<p>
In the example above, the chromatic number was 5, but this is not a counterexample to the Four Color Theorem, since the graph representing the radio stations is not planar. It would be nice to have some quick way to find the chromatic number of a (possibly non-planar) graph. It turns out nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic numbers exists.
</p>

<p>
While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of graph easily, we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number. In other words, we can give upper and lower bounds for chromatic number.
</p>

<p>
This is actually not very difficult: for every graph <m>G</m>, the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is at least 1 and at most the number of vertices of <m>G</m>.

What? You want <em>better</em> bounds on the chromatic number? Well, let's see what we can do.

  Graphs that do not contain <m>K_3</m> are called <term>triangle-free</term>.  In 1955, Jan Mycielski gave a construction which when applied to any triangle-free graph with chromatic number <m>n</m> produced a triangle-free graph with chromatic number <m>n+1</m> (the resulting graph is called the <term>Mycielskian</term> of the original graph).  This proves that the there are graphs without even <m>K_3</m> that have arbitrarily high chromatic number, so the difference between the clique number and chromatic number can be arbitrarily large.

<p>
There are times when the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is <em>equal</em> to the clique number. These graphs have a special name; they are called <term>perfect</term><idx><h>perfect graph</h></idx> (actually for a graph to be perfect, every induced subgraph must have this property). If you know that a graph is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply a matter of searching for the largest clique.<fn>There are special classes of graphs which can be proved to be perfect.  One such class is the set of <term>chordal</term> graphs, which have the property that every cycle in the graph contains a <term>chord</term><mdash/>an edge between two vertices of the cycle which are not adjacent in the cycle.</fn> However, not all graphs are perfect, and searching for the largest clique isn't always easy anyway.

  What about an upper bound?  For planar graphs, <m>\chi(G) \le 4</m>.  Also, if a graph has a proper <m>k</m>-coloring, then <m>\chi(G) \le k</m>, but this requires attempting a coloring first.  Can we do better? It is helpful to recall our attempts to prove the 6- and 5-color theorems.

Any connected graph <m>G</m> satisfies <m>\chi(G) \le \Delta(G)</m>, unless <m>G</m> is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case <m>\chi(G) = \Delta(G) + 1</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
The proof of this theorem is a little tricky.  We will be content with the following special case.
</p>

<activity>
	<statement>
	<p>
	Prove by induction on vertices that any graph <m>G</m> which contains at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> (the maximal degree of all vertices in <m>G</m>) has chromatic number at most <m>\Delta(G)</m>.
	</p>
	</statement>

	<solution>

	<proof>
	<p>
	Let <m>G</m> be a graph with <m>n</m> vertices, maximal degree <m>\Delta(G)</m> and at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m>. Assume for the sake of induction that all graphs <m>G'</m> with fewer than <m>n</m> vertices and a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m> have chromatic number less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>.
</p>
<p>
			Find a vertex of <m>G</m> with degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> and remove it. This forms a subgraph <m>G'</m> which has <m>n-1</m> vertices. Also, since we removed edges, we know that <m>\Delta(G') \le \Delta(G)</m>. If these maximal degrees are equal, then <m>G'</m> must also have a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>, since at least one of its vertices had one more edge in <m>G</m>. In this case, we can apply our inductive hypothesis to produce a coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors. If <m>\Delta(G') \lt  \Delta(G)</m>, then we also can easily find a proper coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors by starting with any vertex and coloring it and all of its neighbors differently, and then fanning out. Thus <m>G'</m> has a proper vertex coloring using just <m>\Delta(G)</m>-many colors.
</p>
<p>
			Now move back to <m>G</m>. Put the removed vertex back into the graph. Since it is adjacent to at most <m>\Delta(G) - 1</m> other vertices, there will be one of the <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors that is not present among its neighbors, which we could use to color the newly inserted vertex.

<title>Coloring Edges</title>
<p>
The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here, we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the edges of a graph <m>G</m> is called the <term>chromatic index</term><idx><h>chromatic index</h></idx> of <m>G</m>, written <m>\chi'(G)</m><notation><usage>\chi'(G)</usage><description>the chromatic index of <m>G</m></description></notation>.

Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess. Everyone will play everyone else once. They have plenty of chess sets but nobody wants to play more than one game at a time. Games will last an hour (thanks to their handy chess clocks). How many hours will the tournament last?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
Represent each player with a vertex and put an edge between two players if they will play each other. In this case, we get the graph <m>K_6</m>:
</p>
<sidebyside width="20%">
	<image>
	<latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}
	\foreach \x in {0,...,5}{

		\foreach \y in {1,...,5}{
		 \draw (\x*60:1) -- (\x*60+\y*60:1);
		}
	\draw (\x*60:1) \v;
	}
	\end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
	</image>
</sidebyside>
<p>
We must color the edges; each color represents a different hour. Since different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored differently, no player will be playing two different games (edges) at the same time. Thus we need to know the chromatic index of <m>K_6</m>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that for sure <m>\chi'(K_6) \ge 5</m>, since there is a vertex of degree 5. It turns out 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring). Therefore the friends will play for 5 hours.
</p>
</solution>
</activity>
<p>
Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5 chess-letes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of <m>K_5</m> is also 5.
</p>

<p>
In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly <m>\chi'(G) \ge \Delta(G)</m>. But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.
</p>

<theorem>
<title>Vizing's Theorem</title>
<statement>
<p>
<idx><h>Vizing's Theorem</h></idx>
For any graph <m>G</m>, the chromatic index <m>\chi'(G)</m> is either <m>\Delta(G)</m> or <m>\Delta(G) + 1</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which <m>\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)</m> are called <em>class 1</em>, while the others are called <em>class 2</em>. Bipartite graphs always satisfy <m>\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)</m>, so are class 1 (this was proved by König in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with <m>\Delta(G) \ge 8</m> are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with <m>2 \le \Delta(G) \le 5</m>. Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with <m>\Delta(G) = 6</m> or <m>\Delta(G) = 7</m> are class 1; the <m>\Delta(G) = 7</m> case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the <m>\Delta(G) = 6</m> case is still open.

Now either all four of these people are acquainted, in which case we are done, or else two of them are not acquainted. Then these two people, together with person 1 make three mutual nonacquaintances. Therefore in every possible case, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers.

		<p>
			<m>R(4,3)=9</m>. We showed above that <m>R(4,3)</m> is more than 8. So we must show that if we have nine people, we either have 4 mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. We can argue that there is at least one person (say person A) who is acquainted with an even number of people. If person A is acquainted with six or more people, then among these six people, there are either three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. If there are three mutual strangers, we are done; if there are three mutual acquaintances, they, together with Person A are four mutual acquaintances. Thus we may assume Person A is acquainted with at most four people. Thus person A is a stranger to at least four people. If two of these people are strangers, then they, together with person A form three mutual strangers and we are done. Otherwise all of these people know each other and we have at least four mutual acquaintances, and so in every possible situation, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers.

			If there are <m>R(m-1,n) +R(m,n-1)</m> people in a room, choose one person, say person <m>P</m>.

				If you could find four mutual acquaintances, you could assume person 1 is among them. And by the generalized pigeonhole principle and symmetry, so are two of the people to the first, second, fourth and eighth to the right. Now there are lots of possibilities for that fourth person. You now have the hard work of using symmetry and the definition of who is acquainted with whom to eliminate all possible combinations of four people. Then you have to think about nonacquaintances.

			<p>
				You cannot find either. If there were a set of four mutual acquaintances, you could assume by symmetry that it includes person 1, and two people from among those one, two, four, and eight places to the right. Thus you can assume your set of four acquaintances contains person 1 and two from among persons 2, 3, 5, and 9. However persons 2 and 5, 2 and 9 and 3 and 9 are not acquainted. Thus three of the mutually acquainted people are either persons 1, 2, and 3, persons 1, 5 and 9 or persons 1, 3, and 5. However person 5 is not acquainted with the person one, two, or eight places to the left of person 1, so if person 5 is in the set of mutual acquaintances, then person 14 must be as well. However person 3 and person 9 are not acquainted with person 14. Thus our set must contain persons 1, 2, and 3. However person 3 is not acquainted with the person one, two, four, or eight persons to the left of person 1, so there is no set of four mutual acquaintances.
