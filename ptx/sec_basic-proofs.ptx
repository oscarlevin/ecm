  <title>Proofs in Combinatorics</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have already seen some basic proof techniques when we considered graph theory: direct proofs, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction.  In this section, we will consider a few proof techniques particular to combinatorics.  Along the way we will establish some basic counting principles and further develop our understanding of binomial coefficients.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why do we care about proofs?  It is not because we doubt the truth of so called theorems or wish to establish new results to further mathematics as an academic discipline (although there is nothing wrong with doing that as well).  Rather, it is through creating proofs that we gain a deeper understanding of the big ideas present in this subject.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-basic-proofs-examples">
    <title>Two Motivating Examples</title>

    <p>
      To get started, let's consider two typical statements in combinatorics which we might wish to prove.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-pascalsym">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all <m>n \ge 0</m> and all <m>0 \le k \le n</m> we have <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  In other words, Pascal's triangle is symmetric reflected over its vertical altitude.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>


    <theorem xml:id="thm-pascalrowsum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For all <m>n \ge 0</m>, we have <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n</m>.  That is, the sum of the entries in the <m>n</m>th row of Pascal's triangle is <m>2^n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      These are just two of the beautiful identities hidden in Pascal's triangle.  But why are they true?
    </p>

    <p>
      There are at least four very distinct proofs we could give for each of these theorems.  The next activities and examples will walk you through a few.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: throughout this section especially, hints to problems are available.  Try the problem first, and if you get stuck, peek at the hint.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, let's try some proofs of <xref ref="thm-pascalsym"/>
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          First, an algebraic proof.  We will see later that <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</m>, where <m>r! = r \cdot (r-1) \cdot (r-2) \cdot\cdots\cdot 2\cdot 1</m> (read <q><m>r</m> factorial</q>).  Using this algebraic formula, prove the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          This should be really easy, but don't let that fool you.  Note that a correct proof must start with one side of the identity and manipulate it into the other side.  The following is NOT a correct proof, because it starts by assuming the statement you wish to prove.

          <md>
            <mrow>\binom{n}{k}  = \amp \binom{n}{n-k}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot (k!(n-k)!)=  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}\cdot(k!(n-k)!)</mrow>
            <mrow>n! =  \amp n!</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have
          <me>
            \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k))!} = \binom{n}{n-k}
          </me>

        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      Note that this proof was not by any means difficult, but it did rely on an algebraic identity we have yet to prove.  We will see in <xref ref="act-pascalrowsum-alg"/> that algebraic proofs can be very messy.  What's more, algebraic proofs rarely explain <em>why</em> an identity is true.  They lack meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slightly more meaning can be found in proofs by induction.  There at least you see the connection to the recursion defining the terms.  We give an example of such an argument here.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We claim the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, so induction would be a natural proof technique to try.  Give a proof by mathematical induction on <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <hint>
        <p>
          You will probably want to use the Pascal recurrence <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>.  Note that once you pick your <m>n</m>, you should argue that the identity holds for all <m>0 \le k \le n</m>.  You should not do double induction.
        </p>
      </hint> -->
      <solution>
        <p>
          We will do induction on <m>n</m>.  For <m>n = 0</m>, the only value of <m>k</m> that is interesting is <m>k=0</m>, and here <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{0}{0} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  Thus the base case is established.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the inductive case, fix an arbitrary <m>n</m> and assume that for all <m>k</m> with <m>0 \le k \le n-1</m> we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{(n-1)-k}</m>.  Consider <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> for an arbitrary <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.  By the recurssion for Pascal's triangle, we have
          <me>
            \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}.
          </me>
          Now apply the induction hypothesis to the right hand side.  We get
          <me>
            \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{n-1-(k-1)} + \binom{n-1}{n-1 -k} = \binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1}.
          </me>
          Then using the Pascal recurrence again, we get
          <me>
            \binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1} = \binom{n}{n-k}.
          </me>
          Thus <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>, as long as <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.  The case where <m>k = n</m> is trivial as <m>\binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0} = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The next two proofs are examples of <term>combinatorial proofs</term>.  
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="act-pascalsym-dc">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Think about what <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> counts.

            Suppose you own <m>n</m> bow ties, and want to choose <m>k</m> of them to take on a trip.  How many different collections of bow ties can you take?

          <p>
            The number of ways to select <m>k</m> bow ties from a set of <m>n</m> bow ties is <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.

            What if you started with all bow ties in the suitcase and got rid of some?  How many do you need to remove?

            First through all your <m>n</m> many bow ties into your suitcase.  Now select <m>n-k</m> bow ties to put (back) into your closet (leaving <m>k</m> in your suitcase).  There are <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m> ways to select the set of bow ties that stay home.

        <solution>

            We have shown that the number of different suitcases of bow ties is both <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m>, so in particular, these must be the same number.

        </solution>

    </activity>

    <p>
      Finally, here is a subtly different proof.
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="act-pascalsym-bij">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the set <m>[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> and its power set <m>\pow([n])</m> of all subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Define the function <m>f:\pow([n]) \to \pow([n])</m> by <m>f(A) = [n]\setminus A</m> for any <m>A \in \pow([n])</m> (that is, <m>f(A)</m> is the complement of <m>A</m> in <m>[n]</m>).

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that <m>f</m> is a bijection.  In fact, <m>f</m> is an <term>involution</term> in that it is its own inverse.

        <statement>
          <p>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Is <m>f</m> still a bijection if we restrict it to just the subsets of <m>[n]</m> that have size <m>k</m>?  Perhaps we should also restrict our codomain (to what?).  Explain.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Why is the above enough to establish the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Recall the bijection principle tells us that if <m>f:X \to Y</m> is a bijection, then <m>\card{X} = \card{Y}</m>.  What is the cardinality of each of the subsets of <m>\pow([n])</m> that we are considering?
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
    </activity>

    <p>
      How are <xref ref="act-pascalsym-dc"/> and <xref ref="act-pascalsym-bij"/> different?  The first consists of answering a single counting question in two different ways, and those ways are the two sides of the identity.  Such proofs are sometimes called <em>double counting proofs</em>, or sometimes just <em>combinatorial proofs</em>.  On the other hand, <xref ref="act-pascalsym-bij"/> proceeds by showing two different sets have the same size, using a bijection, and shows that these two sets are counted by each side of the identity.  These proofs are called <em>bijective proofs</em> (and are also sometimes grouped together with double counting proofs as combinatorial proofs). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is yet another combinatorial proof of the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  We give both double counting and bijective variants.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m> using bit strings.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> counts the number of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m>.  This is because of the <m>n</m> bits, we must choose <m>k</m> to be 1's, which can be done in <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> ways.  The number of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m> is also <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m>, since of the <m>n</m> bits, we must choose <m>n-k</m> to be 0's (making the remaining <m>k</m> 1's), which can be done in <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m> ways.  Thus <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The above is a complete proof, but really <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> can be thought of as <em>defined</em> as the size of the set <m>\B^n_k</m>.  But then <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m> is the size of the set <m>\B^n_{n-k}</m>.  So what we are really saying here is that <m>|\B^n_k| = |\B^n_{n-k}|</m>, which is true because the function that switches 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's in a bit string is a bijection between these two sets.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>


    <p>
      Both styles of combinatorial proof have the advantage that they do an excellent job of illustrating what is really going on in an identity.  They reinforce our understanding of how to solve counting problems and our understanding of basic combinatorial principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not to say that other proof techniques, especially mathematical induction, are not also helpful.  Inductive proofs demonstrate the importance of the recursive nature of combinatorics.  Even if we didn't know what Pascal's triangle told us about the real world, we would see that the identity was true entirely based on the recursive definition of its entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now here are four proofs of <xref ref="thm-pascalrowsum"/>.
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="act-pascalrowsum-alg">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the formula <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k!)}</m>, you should be able to find a common denominator in the sum <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}</m> and show that this simplifies to <m>2^n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          We say <q>should</q>, but please don't waste your time doing this all the way out.  Unless you are really bored.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </activity>


    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We wish to establish the identity <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n</m> for all natural numbers <m>n</m>, so it would be natural to give a proof by induction.  Do this.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Again, use the Pascal recurrence <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>.  Doing this for all summands will give you some repeats.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The base case is trivial: <m>\binom{0}{0} = 1 = 2^0</m>.  Now fix <m>n \gt 0</m> and assume <m>\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} 2^{n-1}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider the case for <m>n</m>.  This is easier to see when written out.
          <md>
            <mrow>\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} \amp + \cdots + \binom{n}{n-1}  + \binom{n}{n} = </mrow>
            <mrow>\binom{n-1}{0} + \left[\binom{n-1}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1}\right] \amp + \cdots + \left[\binom{n-1}{n-2} + \binom{n-1}{n-1}\right] + \binom{n-1}{n-1}.</mrow>
          </md>
          We have replaced <m>\binom{n}{0}</m> with <m>\binom{n-1}{0}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n}</m> with <m>\binom{n-1}{n-1}</m> since they are all 1.  Every other term is replaced using the Pascal recurrence.
        </p>

        <p>
          But notice now that for every <m>k</m>, we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k}</m> appearing exactly twice.  So if we group like terms and factor out a 2, we get
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} = 2 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n.
          </me>
          This completes the inductive case, and therefore the proof.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      There are lots of ways to give a combinatorial proof.  Here is one.
    </p>

    <activity xml:id="activity-pascalrow-dc">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the question: how many subsets of <m>[n]</m> are there?
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many subsets have cardinality 0?  How many have cardinality 1?  And so on.  How many would all of these give us all together?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Your final answer here should be a sum, since we have counted the number of subsets partitioned into disjoint collections.  You will be using the sum principle, which we will formally introduce in the next subsection.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are <m>\binom{n}{0}</m> subsets of size 0, <m>\binom{n}{1}</m> subsets of size 1, and so on, with <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> subsets of size <m>k</m>.  The total number of subsets is then the sum of these numbers: <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why the answer is also <m>2^n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Think about how many choices you have for each element.  You could put 1 in the subset or not.  You could include <m>2</m> in the subset or not.
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            For each element in <m>[n]</m> we can either include it in the subset or not.  So there are two choices for whether <m>1</m> is in the subset, two choices for <m>2</m> and so on.  This gives <m>2^n</m> subsets.  You can also picture this is a tree diagram, making it very clear why you multiply each 2.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <conclusion>
        <p>
          Conclude: Since each side of the identity is the answer to the same counting question, we have established the identity.
        </p>
      </conclusion>
    </activity>

    <p>
      We will not give a bijective proof, although you might include this as part of the above if you didn't see why <m>2^n</m> was the number of subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Instead, you might see directly that <m>2^n</m> is the number of <m>n</m>-bit strings (by writing the numbers 0 through <m>2^n - 1</m> in binary) and then define a bijection from <m>n</m>-bit strings to subsets of <m>[n]</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, here is a clever proof of the identity.

            (1+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 1^{n-k}1^k
          </me>
          <me>
            2^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}.

      This use of the binomial theorem is an example of one of the many uses for <em>generating functions</em> which we will return to later.  For now, you might enjoy plugging in other values to the binomial theorem to uncover new binomial identities.

    <title>Interlude: The Sum and Product Principles</title>

      Any proof you write in mathematics must assume some foundational principles.  In Euclidean geometry, you have axioms, common notions, and often other propositions, used as justification in your proof.  Let's pause to consider two foundational principles in combinatorics that, while intuitively obvious, are worth pointing out as foundational.

      When solving a counting question, it is often advantageous to break the problem into parts.  If you think of the counting question as asking how many ways there are to complete a task, then you might break that task up in various ways, count the number of ways to complete each sub-task, and them combine those somehow to get the number of ways to complete the overall task.  How do you combine them?

        <em>disjoint</em> ways, then completing <q><m>A</m> or <m>B</m></q> is a task that can be completed in <m>m + n</m> ways.

    <p>
      Note, both the sum and product principles are true for more than two subtasks.  You could prove this easily by induction using the principles for two sets as your base case.  But how do we know the principles for two sets are true?
    </p>

    <p>
      To make the sum and product principles more mathematically rigorous, consider operations on sets.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-unioncard">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite, disjoint sets (so <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>) then <m>\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      This suggests that the union of (disjoint) sets somehow corresponds to the <em>disjunction</em> (or) of completing tasks.  You might guess that the set operation that corresponds to <em>conjunction</em> (and) of tasks is set intersection.  But this cannot be correct: the intersection of two sets is no larger than the smallest of the two sets, while combining tasks with conjunction apparently corresponds to multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      A better way to think of the conjunction is as <em>concatenation</em>.  You are performing one task, <em>followed</em> by the other.  Recall that <m>A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A, b \in B\}</m> is the <term>Cartesian product</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>; the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes from <m>A</m> and the second from <m>B</m>.  This is exactly what we need.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-prodcard">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite sets, then <m>\card{A \times B} = \card{A} \cdot \card{B}</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      We could prove these two propositions without too much trouble.  Then we must explain what they have to do with the sum and product principles.

      The previous activity might obscure an important subtlety.  Perhaps you said that the set <m>A</m> corresponds to the face cards (or to the set of outcomes of the task of selecting a face card) and the set <m>B</m> corresponded to the black cards.  The set of outcomes of picking a two card stack is exactly then <m>A \times B</m>, so there are <m>4\cdot 5 = 20</m> outcomes.  This is completely correct.  But does it generalize?

      To illustrate just how fundamental these two principles are, here are a few counting problems that can be solved with them.  For each of these, say exactly where and how the sum and product principles are used.
    </p>

    <exploration xml:id="act-latticepaths2">
      <introduction>
        <p>
          We have seen that the number of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(x,y)</m> is given by <m>\binom{x+y}{x}</m>.  Now with the sum and product principles, we can answer lots of questions about lattice paths.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>

        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Many students want this sort of question to be an example of the sum principle (presumably because to get an acceptable path you travel to <m>(4,7)</m> and then add on a path that gets you the rest of the way.  But notice that you are really concatenating two paths, and there are lots of choices for the first path and lots for the second.  This sounds more like an ordered pair.

    <p>
      The last part of the previous problem illustrates what can go wrong if the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not disjoint.  In general, we have,
      <me>
        \card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.

      This is an example of the <em>Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion</em>, which we will investigate further later.
    </p>

    <p>
      This next set of questions you can answer entirely using the product principle.  While all the activities ask questions with a general <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>, it would be a good idea to first try to answer the corresponding question with specific numbers and then generalize.

        Here are two counting problems, easier than the last two activities, that will lead us to an important general principle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              In how many ways can we pass out <m>k</m> distinct pieces of
              fruit to <m>n</m> children (with no restriction on how many pieces of fruit a child may
              get)?
            </p>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <p>
              Assuming <m>k\le n</m>, in how many ways can we pass out <m>k</m>
              distinct pieces of fruit to
              <m>n</m> children if each child may get at most one? What is the number if <m>k \gt n</m>? Assume for both questions that we pass out all the fruit.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              We must decide on a child for each piece of fruit.  There are <m>n</m> choices for the first piece of fruit, <m>n</m> choices for the second, and so on.  The product principle says that there will be <m>n^k</m> ways to distribute the fruit.  
            </p>

            <p>
              Slightly more mathematically speaking, we are counting the number of functions from a set of cardinality <m>k</m> (the fuits) to a set of cardinality <m>n</m> (the children).  Note that it does not make sense to think of the ways we can send the children to the fruit, since we do not require that every child gets a fruit, and we insist that all fruit is distributed.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The only thing that changes for the secon part is that no child can get more than one piece of fruit.  So while we have <m>n</m> choices for the first piece of fruit, we only have <m>n-1</m> for the second, and <m>n-2</m> for the third.  Continuing until all the fruit is gone gives us a total of,
              <me> n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} </me>
              ways to distribute the fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
              If <m>k \gt n</m>, then the left-hand-side still works: one of the terms will be 0, and indeed, if there is more fruit than children, there is no way to pass out all the fruit while ensuring that each kid gets at most one fruit.

      The last question is an example of a <term>permutation</term>.  We are asking how to arrange <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> kids (arranged by which fruit they get).  There are <m>n!</m> ways to arrange <m>n</m> elements, so there are <m>n!</m> permutations of <m>n</m> elements.  Often we only want to arrange some of these, so we would consider a <m>k</m>-permutation.   We will use this often enough that it deserves its own notation.

          <p>
            How many 5-letter <q>words</q> (i.e., strings of symbols) contain no repeated letters?  There are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, 23 for the fourth and 22 for the fifth, so there are <m>26\cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 = P(26,5)</m> such words.

            How many different shuffled decks of cards are possible?  There are 52 choices for the bottom card, 51 for the next, and so on.  So the answer is <m>P(52,52) = 52!</m>
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            How many <em>injective</em> functions from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> are there?  There are <m>n</m> choices for where 1 is sent, <m>n-1</m> choices for where <m>2</m> is sent (since the function is injective, 2 cannot be sent to the same element as 1), and so on.

      While we are looking at permutations, let's also consider their counterpart, <em>combinations</em>. The key distinction is that while a permutation counts different arrangements as different outcomes, a combination does not.  Combinations are <em>selecting</em>, while permutations are <em>arranging</em> (and also selecting).

      Hopefully you realized that the number of <m>k</m>-combinations of <m>n</m> elements is just <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.  This makes sense: you just need to choose which elements to take, you don't need to arrange them.

    <p>
      Notice though that combinations and permutations <em>are</em> related in some way.  What is that way?  Well, once you have chosen <m>k</m> elements from an <m>n</m>-element set, you could then <em>arrange</em> those <m>k</m> elements to get a permutation.

Alternatively, you could select two from group <m>A</m> in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or two from group <m>B</m> in <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> ways or take one from each in <m>n \cdot n = n^{2}</m> ways.

            <p>
              Here is an alternative, more clever, proof. Look at 123456789. Any increasing number can be made by deleting <em>any</em> subset of digits, except all of them. There are <m>2^{9} - 1</m> such subsets. For example, delete the subset \{2, 4, 7, 9\} and you get 13568. Combining these two approaches actually gives you a nice proof that <m>\binom{9}{0} + \binom{9}{1} + \binom{9}{2} + \ldots + \binom{9}{9} = 2^{9}</m>.

          The above activity illustrates another important reason to use combinatorial proofs: to establish recurrence relations.  The next identity is also a recurrence, this time about <em>derangements</em>.

            <p>
              A <term>derangement</term> of a set of elements is a permutation of those elements so that no element appears in its original position.

              This binary list will look like the standard listing in <m>B^{n}</m> the set of all binary strings of length <m>n</m>. For <m>n=3</m> <m>B^{3} = \{000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111\}</m>. In <m>B^{n}</m> each string has length <m>n</m> and there are <m>2^{n}</m> of them. But half of the <m>n \cdot 2^{n}</m> symbols are 1's. Then the total number of 1's is <m>n2^{n - 1}</m>. Alternatively, we could consider each string and count those with one 1, then those with two 1's, etc.
              There are <m>1 \cdot \binom{n}{1}</m> with one 1, <m>2 \binom{n}{2}</m> total 1's in those binary numbers with exactly two 1's, <m>3 \binom{n}{3}</m> in those with exactly three 1's, and so on.
              The total is <m>1 \binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \ldots + n \binom{n}{n}</m>.  The result now follows by equating <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> to this sum.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let's revisit this identity using equivalence relations. A binary relation <m>R</m> on the set of all binary strings of length <m>n</m> is defined by specifying that <m>(\alpha,\beta) \in R</m> whenever <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> have the same weight. This <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation.
              For <m>n=3</m> there are four different equivalence classes, each containing strings of weight 0, 1, 2, or 3.
              The relation <m>R</m> contains <m>1^{2} + 3^{2} + 3^{2} + 1^{2}</m> ordered pairs; for example, with weight 1 each of the three strings 001, 010, 100 can be paired with any one of those same strings for a total of <m>3^{2} = 9</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              These ordered pairs can be counted in another way. Each ordered pair looks like <m>(- - -,- - -)</m>.  Place 1's in any three positions, and 0's in the others.  If you take the complement of the entries in the second coordinate an element of <m>R</m> is produced.
              Here is what one sequence of this process looks like:
              <me>(- - -, - - -) \rightarrow (- 11,- - 1) \rightarrow (011,001) \rightarrow (011,110)</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reader can check that this process always produces an element of <m>R</m> and that the case of <m>n=3</m> extends easily to general <m>n</m>. Conclusion: choose the <m>n</m> positions for 1's in <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> ways. The result follows.

              Here is a question that might resolve the issue. How many different brick paths of length <m>n</m> (and width 1) can you make using <m>1\times 1</m> bricks and <m>1 \times 2</m> bricks? Let <m>a(n)</m> denote the number of such paths of length <m>n</m>. A few drawings will show that <m>a(1)=1</m>, <m>a(2)=2</m>, <m>a(3)=3</m>, <m>a(4)=5</m>. Since you can place a <m>1\times 1</m> brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 1</m> or a <m>1\times 2</m> brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 2</m> we have that <m>a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2)</m>. This recursion, along with the initial conditions, show that <m>a(n) = F_{n + 1}</m>, the left-hand side of the identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now lets look at all paths of length <m>n</m> and count them by the number of <m>1\times 2</m> bricks. If there are <m>i</m> <m>1\times 2</m> bricks there are <m>n - i</m> total bricks making up the path of length <m>n</m>. Choose the positions of the <m>i</m> <m>1\times 2</m> bricks in <m>\binom{n - i}{i}</m> ways. Now sum as <m>i</m> ranges through the values <m>0, 1, 2, \ldots</m> and obtain <m>\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n - 1}{1} + \binom{n - 2}{2} + \cdots = F_{n + 1}</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>

        <p>
          The reader should draw all paths of length <m>n = 5</m>, for example, and
          examine the cases with <m>i=0, 1, 2</m>. The reader could also explore other proofs.

    <title>Non-combinatorial Proofs in Combinatorics</title>
    
    <p>
      In this section we have stressed a particular style of proof unique to combinatorics: <em>combinatorial proof</em>.  As suggested a few place above, there are often other interesting proofs of combinatorial results that don't use this technique.  We close this section with a few more examples of particularly elegant, non-combinatorial proofs.

      We start with a well known theorem about the relationship between square and triangular numbers.
