    This book is a synthesis of three textbooks on discrete mathematics and combinatorics.  First, many of the problems, and indeed entire sections, come directly from <pubtitle>Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery</pubtitle> by Kenneth P. Bogart.  This is possible thanks to the Bogart estate's decision to release his book under an open license (the GFDL, the same license this text uses).  The format of this book has been made to match that of Bogart's text, with most of the exposition being driven by problems (which we call <em>activities</em>) for students to work on.  A copy of Bogart's book can be found for free at <url href="http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/">bogart.openmathbooks.org</url>.
  </p>
        <p>
    The second source for material is <pubtitle>Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics</pubtitle> by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus.  This is a set of notes used for many years as the textbook for MATH 528 at the University of Northern Colorado.  We have tried to capture the flavor and emphasis of this book, and have used many of its exercises among our <em>activities</em>.
  </p>
        <p>
    For the background material contained in the index, as well as much of the chapter on graph theory, material was borrowed from <pubtitle>Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction</pubtitle>, the book I wrote for the undergraduate discrete course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This book can be found (for free) at <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/">discrete.openmathbooks.org</url>.
  </p>
        <p>
    Finally, thanks to Ricardo Diaz for his helpful suggestions while compiling this book.  And thanks in advance to all the students who will soon be contacting me with suggestions for improvements.

  This book was written specifically to be used as the textbook for the Master's level Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This course is part of a MA in Mathematics with a Teaching Emphasis.  Most of the students in the course are current secondary math teachers.  This intended audience has influenced the style and content of the book in a few important ways.
</p>
        <p>
  First, we acknowledge that not everyone reading this book will be immediately familiar with the content of a standard undergraduate discrete mathematics course.  Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof.  For the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions), background material is included in an Appendix.
</p>
        <p>
  Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers.  We have put an emphasis on understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way.  Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum, most of the questions here are at a higher level.  Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by our questions have applications to secondary mathematics.  This emphasis is quite different than other mid level discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research mathematics.
</p>
        <p>
  While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice.  As you will see, almost all of the textbook consists of <em>Activities</em> and <em>Exercises</em> that guide students to discover mathematics for themselves.  This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics.  Most of all, discovering mathematics is fun.
</p>
        <paragraphs>
          <title>How to use this book</title>
          <p>
    This book is mostly about solving problems, and using those problems and their solutions to develop mathematics and mathematical understanding.  The main three chapters consist of more than 300 <em>activities</em> and <em>exercises</em> which the reader is asked to complete.  That is how you should use the book.  As you read, when you come to an activity, really take some time to try to solve it.  Many of the activities are broken down into tasks to help guide you to a solution.  If you get stuck, check for a hint.  In the pdf, problems with hints are marked with a small <q>[hint]</q> link that will take you to the hint in the back of the book; clicking on the number of the hint will return you to the activity.  The online version has expandable hint links under any activities for which they are provided. 
  </p>
          <p>
    The exercises are similar to activities, but can be thought of as optional.  In particular, it is less important that you complete the exercise immediately, as they are not used to motivate the next part of the text.  Some of the exercises allow you to deepen your understanding of a topic; others are just for practice.
  </p>
          <p>
    Solutions are not provided explicitly, but often the important content of an activity will be explained further into the book.  We have made every effort to make the problems <q>self checking</q> so that you do not run the risk of learning something false.  
  </p>
          <p>
    For the most part, if you are unable to complete an activity, assuming you have put a reasonable effort in already, it would be safe to move on.  If the activity is meant to guide you to a fundamental concept, that will become apparent, and later activities and exposition will help you uncover that concept.  Other activities are meant to provide interesting examples of these big ideas, but missing any one of them will not impede your progress on other activities.

        <!-- TODO: add example related to graphs -->
        <p>
One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count. Now we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely. For example:
<ul><li>
<p>
In a group of 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes took place?
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
How many ways can you distribute <m>10</m> girl scout cookies to <m>7</m> boy scouts?
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
How many anagrams are there of <q>anagram</q>?
</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
        <p>
Before tackling questions like these, let's look at the basics of counting.

            <p>
       Treating Pascal's Triangle as nothing more than a triangular array of numbers, what do you notice about it?  Are there any patterns to the numbers? Try to find some patterns and then see if you can answer (or have already answered) the following:
     </p>
          </introduction>
          <task>
            <p>
      How are the entries in the triangle found?  What would the next row down be?
    </p>
          </task>
          <task>
            <p>
      What is the sum of the entries in the <m>n</m>th row?
    </p>
          </task>
          <task>
            <p>
      What is <m>1 - 5 + 10 - 10 + 5 - 1</m>?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?
    </p>
          </task>
          <task>
            <p>
      What is <m>1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15</m>?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?
    </p>
          </task>
          <task>
            <p>
      What is <m>1+ 7 + 15 + 10 + 1</m>?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?
    </p>
          </task>
          <task>
            <p>
      Are there any groups of numbers in the triangle that are particularly recognizable?
    </p>
          </task>
        </activity>
        <p>
    We would like to understand why the patterns you discovered above exist, and to prove that they really do exist everywhere in the triangle.  There are at least two ways we can proceed (and we will try to proceed in both ways to maximize our understanding).  First, we can use notation to describe the entries in the triangle, provide a definition for what each entry is, and prove our results entirely based on these definitions.  Second, we can ascribe some <em>meaning</em> to the entries in the triangle, saying what the numbers represent, and then make arguments about those representations.
  </p>
        <p>
    <!-- weak: -->
    The advantage to pursuing both these approaches is that doing so creates a feedback loop.  A fact we establish using pure symbolic manipulation allows us to conclude something about the real world and what these numbers represent.  That helps us understand the applications better, which in turn might help us make arguments about those applications, which can then establish a purely symbolic fact about the triangle.
  </p>
        <p>
    Let's pause and just for fun consider a few discrete math questions that probably have nothing to do with Pascal's Triangle or each other.  Probably.

        Recall that a <term>subset</term> <m>A</m> of a set <m>B</m> is a set all of whose elements are also elements of <m>B</m>; we write <m>A \subseteq B</m>.  For example, some of the subsets of <m>B = \{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> are <m>\{2,4,5\}</m>, <m>\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> and <m>\emptyset</m>.  Recall also that the <term>cardinality</term> of a set is simply the number of elements in it.
      </p>
            <p>
        Since we will often consider sets of the form <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}</m>, let's adopt the notation <m>[n]</m> for this set.

        Some definitions: A <term>bit</term> is either 0 or 1 (bit is short for <q>binary digit</q>).  Thus a <term>bit string</term> is a string of bits.  The <term>length</term> of a bit string is the number of bits in the string; the <term>weight</term> of a bit string is the number of 1's in the string (or equivalently, the sum of the bits). A <term><m>n</m>-bit string</term> means a bit string of length <m>n</m>.
      </p>
            <p>
        We will write <m>\B^n_k</m> to mean the set of all <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m>.  So for example, some of the elements in <m>\B^5_3</m> are,
        <me>
          11100 \qquad 10101 \qquad 01101.

    Hopefully by now you have some questions that are begging to be answered.  Here are two that we will focus on specifically:
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          Why are the answers to all the counting questions above the same as each other?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Why are the answers to all the counting questions above numbers in Pascal's triangle?
        </p>
      </li></ol>
  </p>
        <p>
    We could answer the first question by answering the second: if we can say why each answer is a particular entry in Pascal's triangle, then we know two answers will be equal because they are in the same place on the triangle.  But we can do better.  In fact, we should be able to explain why these counting questions correspond to each other without knowing <em>any</em> of the answers.

          This is a little harder.  It might help to notice that there is really nothing special about <m>[n]</m> except that it contains <m>n</m> elements.  In fact, what can you say about the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of <em>any</em> <m>n</m>-element set?  Then, what <m>n</m>-element set would we look at when expanding <m>(x+y)^n</m>?

    Are you satisfied with the explanations you gave above?  Do you think they would count as a formal mathematical proof that the counting questions have the same answer?  One way to make this sort of an argument more precise is to involve precisely defined mathematical objects.

        <p>
    The previous activity was meant to help you discover what is usually called the <term>bijection principle</term>: <em>Two sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> have the same cardinality if and only if there is a bijection <m>f:X \to Y</m></em>.
  </p>
        <p>
    If you want to prove that two sets have the same number of elements, all that is required is to define a function from one set to the other, and prove that the function is a bijection.  For us, those two sets will be the set of outcomes we are counting.  So for example, we can show that the <em>set</em> of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m> has the same cardinality as the <em>set</em> of <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  This will prove that the counting questions, <q>how many <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m> are there?</q> and, <q>how many <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[n]</m> are there?</q> have the same answer.
  </p>
        <p>

  </p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
        Define a bijection <m>f:X \to Y</m> where <m>X</m> is the set of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(k,n-k)</m> and <m>Y</m> is the set of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m>. Prove that <m>f</m> really is a bijection.
      </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
        This really comes down to how to represent the elements of the set <m>X</m>. We represent a lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(k, n-k)</m> as a sequence of <em>R</em>'s and <em>U</em>'s, representing a step to the right or a step up.  Note that this means that each lattice path will be a sequence containing a total of <m>n</m> symbols, of which <m>k</m> will be <em>R</em>'s. 
      </p>
            <p>
        Now we can define the bijection.  The function <m>f</m> takes a string of <em>R</em>'s and <em>U</em>'s, and replaces each <em>R</em> with a 1 and each <em>U</em> with a 0.  
      </p>
            <p>
        To prove this is a bijection, there are four things we need to check: 
        <ol><li>
            That <m>f(x)</m> is defined for each <m>x \in X</m> (i.e., every lattice path is sent to some <m>n</m>-bit string of weight <m>k</m>).</li><li>
            That <m>f(x)</m> is <em>uniquely</em> defined for each <m>x \in X</m> (i.e., no lattice path is sent to more than one bit string).</li><li>
            That every <m>y \in Y</m> is the image of at least one <m>x \in X</m> (i.e., that every <m>n</m>-bit string of weight <m>k</m> is the output of the function at least once).
          </li><li>
            That every <m>y \in Y</m> is the image of at most one <m>x \in X</m> (i.e., that no <m>n</m>-bit string of weight <m>k</m> is the output of the function more than once.)
          </li></ol>
        The first two conditions guarantee that <m>f</m> will be a function.  The third says that <m>f</m> is onto (a surjection).  The fourth says that <m>f</m> is one-to-one (an injection).
      </p>
            <p>
        Let's do this.  First, since elements in <m>X</m> contain <m>k</m> <em>R</em>'s and <m>n-k</m> <em>U</em>'s, applying the rule for <m>f</m> will result in a bit string containing <m>k</m> 1's and <m>n-k</m> 0's, for a total length of <m>n</m>.  Thus each element of <m>X</m> will be sent to an element of <m>Y</m>.  Further, it is not possible for an element of <m>X</m> to be sent to more than one element of <m>Y</m> since our procedure is well defined.
      </p>
            <p>
        To show that <m>f</m> is surjective, consider an arbitrary <m>y \in Y</m>.  If we replace each 1 with an <em>R</em> and each 0 with a <em>U</em>, then we get an element <m>x \in X</m> (because of the length of weight of the strings) and then <m>f(x) = y</m>.
      </p>
            <p>
        Finally, to show that <m>f</m> is injective, consider <m>x_1, x_2 \in X</m> and suppose <m>x_1 \ne x_2</m>.  Then there is a first position in which they differ (a point on the lattice path where one path goes right and the other goes up).  But then this bit will be different in <m>f(x_1)</m> and <m>f(x_2)</m>.
      </p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <exploration>
          <statement>
            <p>

        Can you now conclude that the number of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(k,n-k)</m> is the same as the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[n]</m>?  Can you easily give the bijection (and be sure it is really a bijection)?

        </exploration>
        <p>
    What the example and problems above say is that all these counting questions correspond to each other.  But why do the answers always appear in Pascal's triangle?  To answer this, we need to start with a definition for the numbers in Pascal's triangle.
  </p>
        <p>
    First, some notation: let's write <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> for the <m>k</m>th entry in row <m>n</m>.  For both <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>, start counting at 0.  So for example <m>\binom{5}{1} = 5</m>, and <m>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</m> for all <m>n</m> (or at least the ones we can see).  We will read <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> as <q><m>n</m> choose <m>k</m></q> for reasons that will become clear soon.
  </p>
        <p>
    Now we need to decide what <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> should be defined as.  It is not enough to simply define it as the specific entry in Pascal's triangle, since we haven't yet defined Pascal's triangle (we will want to define Pascal's triangle as the triangle of the numbers <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>).  Here are some choices:
  </p>
        <assemblage>
          <title>Possible Definitions for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m></title>
          <p>
      <idx><h>binomial coefficients</h></idx> For each integer <m>n \ge 0</m> and integer <m>k</m> with <m>0 \le k \le n</m> the number
      <me>
        {n\choose k},
      </me>
      read <q><m>n</m> choose <m>k</m></q> is:
      <ol><li>the number of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m>, that is, <m>{n\choose k} = |\B^n_k|</m>.</li><li><m>{n \choose k}</m> is the number of subsets of a set of size <m>n</m> each with cardinality <m>k</m>.</li><li><m>{n \choose k}</m> is the number of lattice paths of length <m>n</m> containing <m>k</m> steps to the right.</li><li><m>{n \choose k}</m> is the coefficient of <m>x^ky^{n-k}</m> in the expansion of <m>(x+y)^n</m>.</li><li><m>{n \choose k}</m> is the number of ways to select <m>k</m> objects from a total of <m>n</m> objects.</li><li>
          <p>
            <m>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</m> and for all <m>n \ge 1</m> and <m>1 \lt k \lt n</m> we have <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>.
          </p>
        </li></ol>
    </p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>
    You have already proved that choices 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent, and we have good reason to believe these are also equivalent to choice 4.
  </p>
        <p>
    What about choice 5?  This is new, although not really, as it captures all of the previous four: Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3?  We must choose <m>3</m> of the 5 bits to be 1's.  There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways to do this, so there are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> such bit strings.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
        How many subsets of <m>\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> contain exactly 3 elements?  We must choose <m>3</m> of the 5 elements to be in our subset.  There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways to do this, so there are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> such subsets.
        </p>

        How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right.  There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways to do this, so there are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> such lattice paths.

        What is the coefficient of <m>x^3y^2</m> in the expansion of <m>(x+y)^5</m>?  We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an <m>x</m>.  There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways to do this, so the coefficient is <m>{5 \choose 3}</m>.

    In fact, choice 5 is usually taken as the definition of <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>, which is why we say <m>n</m> <em>choose</em> <m>k</m>.  Although interestingly enough, the other common name for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is a <term>binomial coefficient</term>, which refers to the coefficients of the binomial <m>(x+y)^n</m>.

        <p>
    What does all this have to do with Pascal's triangle though?  You might think of the entries in the triangle as the result of adding the two entries above it.  That is, Pascal's triangle contains those numbers described by choice 6 above.

        The last piece of the puzzle is to connect this definition to all the others.  Of course given the work done above, it would be enough to prove that any one of the models for binomial coefficients match the recurrence for Pascal's triangle, but it is instructive to check all four.

      <!-- We have already seen some basic proof techniques when we considered graph theory: direct proofs, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction.   -->
      In this section, we will consider a few proof techniques particular to combinatorics.  Along the way we will establish some basic counting principles and further develop our understanding of binomial coefficients.
    </p>
          <p>
      Why do we care about proofs?  It is not because we doubt the truth of so called theorems or wish to establish new results to further mathematics as an academic discipline (although there is nothing wrong with doing that as well).  Rather, it is through creating proofs that we gain a deeper understanding of the big ideas present in this subject.

          <title>Two Motivating Examples</title>
          <p>
      To get started, let's consider two typical statements in combinatorics which we might wish to prove.
    </p>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-pascalsym">
            <statement>
              <p>
          For all <m>n \ge 0</m> and all <m>0 \le k \le n</m> we have <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  In other words, Pascal's triangle is symmetric reflected over its vertical altitude.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </theorem>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-pascalrowsum">
            <statement>
              <p>
          For all <m>n \ge 0</m>, we have <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n</m>.  That is, the sum of the entries in the <m>n</m>th row of Pascal's triangle is <m>2^n</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </theorem>
          <p>
      These are just two of the beautiful identities hidden in Pascal's triangle.  But why are they true?
    </p>
          <p>
      There are at least four very distinct proofs we could give for each of these theorems.  The next activities and examples will walk you through a few.
    </p>
          <p>
      Note: throughout this section especially, hints to problems are available.  Try the problem first, and if you get stuck, peek at the hint.
    </p>
          <p>
      First, let's try some proofs of <xref ref="thm-pascalsym"/>
    </p>
          <activity>
            <statement>
              <p>
          First, an algebraic proof.  We will see later that <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</m>, where <m>r! = r \cdot (r-1) \cdot (r-2) \cdot\cdots\cdot 2\cdot 1</m> (read <q><m>r</m> factorial</q>).  Using this algebraic formula, prove the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
              <p>
          This should be really easy, but don't let that fool you.  Note that a correct proof must start with one side of the identity and manipulate it into the other side.  The following is NOT a correct proof, because it starts by assuming the statement you wish to prove.

          <md><mrow>\binom{n}{k}  = \amp \binom{n}{n-k}</mrow><mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}</mrow><mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!)}</mrow><mrow>\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot (k!(n-k)!)=  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}\cdot(k!(n-k)!)</mrow><mrow>n! =  \amp n!</mrow></md>
        </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>
          We have
          <me>
            \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k))!} = \binom{n}{n-k}
          </me>

        </p>
            </solution>
          </activity>
          <p>
      Note that this proof was not by any means difficult, but it did rely on an algebraic identity we have yet to prove.  We will see in <xref ref="act-pascalrowsum-alg"/> that algebraic proofs can be very messy.  What's more, algebraic proofs rarely explain <em>why</em> an identity is true.  They lack meaning.
    </p>
          <p>
      Slightly more meaning can be found in proofs by induction.  There at least you see the connection to the recursion defining the terms.  We give an example of such an argument here.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          We claim the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, so induction would be a natural proof technique to try.  Give a proof by mathematical induction on <m>n</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <hint>
        <p>
          You will probably want to use the Pascal recurrence <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>.  Note that once you pick your <m>n</m>, you should argue that the identity holds for all <m>0 \le k \le n</m>.  You should not do double induction.
        </p>
      </hint> -->
            <solution>
              <p>
          We will do induction on <m>n</m>.  For <m>n = 0</m>, the only value of <m>k</m> that is interesting is <m>k=0</m>, and here <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{0}{0} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  Thus the base case is established.
        </p>
              <p>
          For the inductive case, fix an arbitrary <m>n</m> and assume that for all <m>k</m> with <m>0 \le k \le n-1</m> we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{(n-1)-k}</m>.  Consider <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> for an arbitrary <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.  By the recurssion for Pascal's triangle, we have
          <me>
            \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}.
          </me>
          Now apply the induction hypothesis to the right hand side.  We get
          <me>
            \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{n-1-(k-1)} + \binom{n-1}{n-1 -k} = \binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1}.
          </me>
          Then using the Pascal recurrence again, we get
          <me>
            \binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1} = \binom{n}{n-k}.
          </me>
          Thus <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>, as long as <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.  The case where <m>k = n</m> is trivial as <m>\binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0} = 1</m>.
        </p>
            </solution>

      How are <xref ref="act-pascalsym-dc"/> and <xref ref="act-pascalsym-bij"/> different?  The first consists of answering a single counting question in two different ways, and those ways are the two sides of the identity.  Such proofs are sometimes called <em>double counting proofs</em>, or sometimes just <em>combinatorial proofs</em>.  On the other hand, <xref ref="act-pascalsym-bij"/> proceeds by showing two different sets have the same size, using a bijection, and shows that these two sets are counted by each side of the identity.  These proofs are called <em>bijective proofs</em> (and are also sometimes grouped together with double counting proofs as combinatorial proofs). 
    </p>
          <p>
      Here is yet another combinatorial proof of the identity <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>.  We give both double counting and bijective variants.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Prove that <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m> using bit strings.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> counts the number of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m>.  This is because of the <m>n</m> bits, we must choose <m>k</m> to be 1's, which can be done in <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> ways.  The number of <m>n</m>-bit strings of weight <m>k</m> is also <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m>, since of the <m>n</m> bits, we must choose <m>n-k</m> to be 0's (making the remaining <m>k</m> 1's), which can be done in <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m> ways.  Thus <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}</m>. 
        </p>
              <p>
          The above is a complete proof, but really <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> can be thought of as <em>defined</em> as the size of the set <m>\B^n_k</m>.  But then <m>\binom{n}{n-k}</m> is the size of the set <m>\B^n_{n-k}</m>.  So what we are really saying here is that <m>|\B^n_k| = |\B^n_{n-k}|</m>, which is true because the function that switches 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's in a bit string is a bijection between these two sets.
        </p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
      Both styles of combinatorial proof have the advantage that they do an excellent job of illustrating what is really going on in an identity.  They reinforce our understanding of how to solve counting problems and our understanding of basic combinatorial principles.
    </p>
          <p>
      This is not to say that other proof techniques, especially mathematical induction, are not also helpful.  Inductive proofs demonstrate the importance of the recursive nature of combinatorics.  Even if we didn't know what Pascal's triangle told us about the real world, we would see that the identity was true entirely based on the recursive definition of its entries.

      Now here are four proofs of <xref ref="thm-pascalrowsum"/>.

          We wish to establish the identity <m>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n</m> for all natural numbers <m>n</m>, so it would be natural to give a proof by induction.  Do this.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
              <p>
          Again, use the Pascal recurrence <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>.  Doing this for all summands will give you some repeats.
        </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>
          The base case is trivial: <m>\binom{0}{0} = 1 = 2^0</m>.  Now fix <m>n \gt 0</m> and assume <m>\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} 2^{n-1}</m>.
        </p>
              <p>
          Consider the case for <m>n</m>.  This is easier to see when written out.
          <md><mrow>\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} \amp + \cdots + \binom{n}{n-1}  + \binom{n}{n} = </mrow><mrow>\binom{n-1}{0} + \left[\binom{n-1}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1}\right] \amp + \cdots + \left[\binom{n-1}{n-2} + \binom{n-1}{n-1}\right] + \binom{n-1}{n-1}.</mrow></md>
          We have replaced <m>\binom{n}{0}</m> with <m>\binom{n-1}{0}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{n}</m> with <m>\binom{n-1}{n-1}</m> since they are all 1.  Every other term is replaced using the Pascal recurrence.
        </p>
              <p>
          But notice now that for every <m>k</m>, we have <m>\binom{n-1}{k}</m> appearing exactly twice.  So if we group like terms and factor out a 2, we get
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} = 2 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n.
          </me>
          This completes the inductive case, and therefore the proof.

      We will not give a bijective proof, although you might include this as part of the above if you didn't see why <m>2^n</m> was the number of subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Instead, you might see directly that <m>2^n</m> is the number of <m>n</m>-bit strings (by writing the numbers 0 through <m>2^n - 1</m> in binary) and then define a bijection from <m>n</m>-bit strings to subsets of <m>[n]</m>.

      When solving a counting question, it is often advantageous to break the problem into parts.  If you think of the counting question as asking how many ways there are to complete a task, then you might break that task up in various ways, count the number of ways to complete each sub-task, and them combine those somehow to get the number of ways to complete the overall task.  How do you combine them?

      Note, both the sum and product principles are true for more than two subtasks.  You could prove this easily by induction using the principles for two sets as your base case.  But how do we know the principles for two sets are true?
    </p>
          <p>
      To make the sum and product principles more mathematically rigorous, consider operations on sets.
    </p>
          <proposition xml:id="prop-unioncard">
            <statement>
              <p>
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are finite, disjoint sets (so <m>A \cap B = \emptyset</m>) then <m>\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </proposition>
          <p>
      This suggests that the union of (disjoint) sets somehow corresponds to the <em>disjunction</em> (or) of completing tasks.  You might guess that the set operation that corresponds to <em>conjunction</em> (and) of tasks is set intersection.  But this cannot be correct: the intersection of two sets is no larger than the smallest of the two sets, while combining tasks with conjunction apparently corresponds to multiplication.
    </p>
          <p>
      A better way to think of the conjunction is as <em>concatenation</em>.  You are performing one task, <em>followed</em> by the other.  Recall that <m>A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A, b \in B\}</m> is the <term>Cartesian product</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>; the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes from <m>A</m> and the second from <m>B</m>.  This is exactly what we need.

        Here are two counting problems, easier than the last two activities, that will lead us to an important general principle.
        <ol><li>
            <p>
              In how many ways can we pass out <m>k</m> distinct pieces of
              fruit to <m>n</m> children (with no restriction on how many pieces of fruit a child may
              get)?
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Assuming <m>k\le n</m>, in how many ways can we pass out <m>k</m>
              distinct pieces of fruit to
              <m>n</m> children if each child may get at most one? What is the number if <m>k \gt n</m>? Assume for both questions that we pass out all the fruit.
            </p>
          </li></ol>
      </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
        <ol><li>
            <p>
              We must decide on a child for each piece of fruit.  There are <m>n</m> choices for the first piece of fruit, <m>n</m> choices for the second, and so on.  The product principle says that there will be <m>n^k</m> ways to distribute the fruit.  
            </p>

            <p>
              Slightly more mathematically speaking, we are counting the number of functions from a set of cardinality <m>k</m> (the fuits) to a set of cardinality <m>n</m> (the children).  Note that it does not make sense to think of the ways we can send the children to the fruit, since we do not require that every child gets a fruit, and we insist that all fruit is distributed.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              The only thing that changes for the second part is that no child can get more than one piece of fruit.  So while we have <m>n</m> choices for the first piece of fruit, we only have <m>n-1</m> for the second, and <m>n-2</m> for the third.  Continuing until all the fruit is gone gives us a total of,
              <me> n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} </me>
              ways to distribute the fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
              If <m>k \gt n</m>, then the left-hand-side still works: one of the terms will be 0, and indeed, if there is more fruit than children, there is no way to pass out all the fruit while ensuring that each kid gets at most one fruit.
            </p>
          </li></ol>

          <p>
      The last question is an example of a <term>permutation</term>.  We are asking how to arrange <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> kids (arranged by which fruit they get).  There are <m>n!</m> ways to arrange <m>n</m> elements, so there are <m>n!</m> permutations of <m>n</m> elements.  Often we only want to arrange some of these, so we would consider a <m>k</m>-permutation.   We will use this often enough that it deserves its own notation.

          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            How many different shuffled decks of cards are possible?  There are 52 choices for the bottom card, 51 for the next, and so on.  So the answer is <m>P(52,52) = 52!</m>
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            How many <em>injective</em> functions from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> are there?  There are <m>n</m> choices for where 1 is sent, <m>n-1</m> choices for where <m>2</m> is sent (since the function is injective, 2 cannot be sent to the same element as 1), and so on.  So the answer is <m>P(n,k)</m>.

      While we are looking at permutations, let's also consider their counterpart, <em>combinations</em>. The key distinction is that while a permutation counts different arrangements as different outcomes, a combination does not.  Combinations are <em>selecting</em>, while permutations are <em>arranging</em> (and also selecting).

              Suppose you have a set of <m>m</m> bow ties and <m>n</m> fezzes and you want to form fez-bow tie outfits. This can clearly be done in <m>mn</m> ways. Or, you could choose 2 from the total of <m>m + n</m> items and delete the bow tie only pairs (there are <m>\binom{m}{2}</m> of these) and delete the fez only pairs (also <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> of these). Since we have counted this one set with two different expressions (the left hand side and the right hand side of the identity), those expressions are equal.

          You could also attempt an algebraic proof or perhaps a geometric proof making use of figures consisting of triangular numbers (we will return to this identity at the end of the section to illustrate this). Also, as a challenge, the reader could formulate a similar result involving <m>\binom{a + b + c}{3}</m> and a corresponding proof.

              The answer looks like it might be almost the sum of a row in Pascal's triangle.  Why does this make sense?  You could think of including, or excluding numbers.

              There are <m>\binom{9}{1}</m> single digit type, <m>\binom{9}{2}</m> double digit type (just select 2 of the 9 digits <m>1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9</m> and arrange in order), <ellipsis/>, and so on to see that there are <m>\binom{9}{9}</m> nine digit type. The total is <m>\binom{9}{1} + \binom{9}{2} + \binom{9}{3} + \ldots + \binom{9}{9} = 2^{9} - 1</m>.
            </p>
              <p>
              Here is an alternative, more clever, proof. Look at 123456789. Any increasing number can be made by deleting <em>any</em> subset of digits, except all of them. There are <m>2^{9} - 1</m> such subsets. For example, delete the subset \{2, 4, 7, 9\} and you get 13568. Combining these two approaches actually gives you a nice proof that <m>\binom{9}{0} + \binom{9}{1} + \binom{9}{2} + \ldots + \binom{9}{9} = 2^{9}</m>.

              Contrast this discussion with that presented in <xref ref="act_anysizecommittee"/>. Look at the set of the first <m>2^{n}</m> natural numbers <m>0,1,2,\ldots,2^{n} - 1</m>. When you convert each to binary form what is the total number of 1s written?
              This binary list will look like the standard listing in <m>B^{n}</m> the set of all binary strings of length <m>n</m>. For <m>n=3</m> <m>B^{3} = \{000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111\}</m>. In <m>B^{n}</m> each string has length <m>n</m> and there are <m>2^{n}</m> of them. But half of the <m>n \cdot 2^{n}</m> symbols are 1's. Then the total number of 1's is <m>n2^{n - 1}</m>. Alternatively, we could consider each string and count those with one 1, then those with two 1's, etc.
              There are <m>1 \cdot \binom{n}{1}</m> with one 1, <m>2 \binom{n}{2}</m> total 1's in those binary numbers with exactly two 1's, <m>3 \binom{n}{3}</m> in those with exactly three 1's, and so on.
              The total is <m>1 \binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \ldots + n \binom{n}{n}</m>.  The result now follows by equating <m>n2^{n - 1}</m> to this sum.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let's revisit this identity using equivalence relations. A binary relation <m>R</m> on the set of all binary strings of length <m>n</m> is defined by specifying that <m>(\alpha,\beta) \in R</m> whenever <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> have the same weight. This <m>R</m> is an equivalence relation.
              For <m>n=3</m> there are four different equivalence classes, each containing strings of weight 0, 1, 2, or 3.
              The relation <m>R</m> contains <m>1^{2} + 3^{2} + 3^{2} + 1^{2}</m> ordered pairs; for example, with weight 1 each of the three strings 001, 010, 100 can be paired with any one of those same strings for a total of <m>3^{2} = 9</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              These ordered pairs can be counted in another way. Each ordered pair looks like <m>(- - -,- - -)</m>.  Place 1's in any three positions, and 0's in the others.  If you take the complement of the entries in the second coordinate an element of <m>R</m> is produced.
              Here is what one sequence of this process looks like:
              <me>(- - -, - - -) \rightarrow (- 11,- - 1) \rightarrow (011,001) \rightarrow (011,110)</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reader can check that this process always produces an element of <m>R</m> and that the case of <m>n=3</m> extends easily to general <m>n</m>. Conclusion: choose the <m>n</m> positions for 1's in <m>\binom{2n}{n}</m> ways. The result follows.

              The right-hand side, <m>n!</m>, gives the number of permutations of <m>n</m> objects. So the left-hand side must provide the same enumeration. The left side partitions the permutations according to how many elements are deranged (and the rest fixed). The term <m>\binom{n}{i} d_{i} = \binom{n}{n - i} d_{i}</m> gives the number of permutations of <m>n</m> where <m>n - i</m> elements are fixed and the remaining <m>i</m> elements are deranged.

Let <m>a(n)</m> denote the number of such paths of length <m>n</m>. A few drawings will show that <m>a(1)=1</m>, <m>a(2)=2</m>, <m>a(3)=3</m>, <m>a(4)=5</m>. Since you can place a <m>1\times 1</m> brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 1</m> or a <m>1\times 2</m> brick in front of all paths of length <m>n - 2</m> we have that <m>a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2)</m>. This recursion, along with the initial conditions, show that <m>a(n) = F_{n + 1}</m>, the left-hand side of the identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now lets look at all paths of length <m>n</m> and count them by the number of <m>1\times 2</m> bricks. If there are <m>i</m> <m>1\times 2</m> bricks there are <m>n - i</m> total bricks making up the path of length <m>n</m>. Choose the positions of the <m>i</m> <m>1\times 2</m> bricks in <m>\binom{n - i}{i}</m> ways. Now sum as <m>i</m> ranges through the values <m>0, 1, 2, \ldots</m> and obtain <m>\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n - 1}{1} + \binom{n - 2}{2} + \cdots = F_{n + 1}</m>.

          <title>Non-combinatorial Proofs in Combinatorics</title>
          <p>
      In this section we have stressed a particular style of proof unique to combinatorics: <em>combinatorial proof</em>.  As suggested a few place above, there are often other interesting proofs of combinatorial results that don't use this technique.  We close this section with a few more examples of particularly elegant, non-combinatorial proofs.

          <p>
      We start with a well known theorem about the relationship between square and triangular numbers.

        <title>Counting with Equivalence</title>
        <introduction>
          <!-- Here we will discuss the relationship between combinations and permutations from an advanced mathematical perspective: we are counting equivalence classes.  We will then consider some other examples of this and some non-examples (why you cannot always do this). -->
          <p>
  So far we have been able to solve our counting problems simply by use of the sum and product principles, together with the fact that the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set is <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> (the values of which can be found in Pascal's triangle). This means that we have always <em>built up</em> the set of outcomes by combining smaller sets of outcomes combined in various ways.
</p>
          <p>
  It is often useful to go the other way.  We could purposely over count the number of outcomes, but in a way that we can recover the correct set.

          <title>The Quotient Principle</title>
          <p>
    In <xref ref="act-binomformula"/>, you proved the algebraic formula <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}</m>.  However, this was done rather indirectly.  First you proved the identity <m>P(n,k) = \binom{n}{k}k!</m>, then wrote <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m>, and finally solved for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
  </p>
          <p>
    This approach has the advantage of illustrating the connection between combinations and permutations, but the combinatorial argument that both sides of the identity are equal asked you to count the number of <em>permutations</em> in two ways.  It is instructive to think of this equation in terms of <em>combinations</em> instead.  Let's start with a concrete example.

          <activity>
            <introduction>
              <p>
        Let's count the number of subsets of <m>\{a,b,c,d,e\}</m> of size 3.  Of course we already know the answer should be <m>\binom{5}{3}</m>, which we can see in Pascal's triangle is equal to 10.  What might you try if you didn't already know this?

                <p>
          You might first guess that the answer is <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3</m> since there are 5 choices for which element you put in your subset first, then  4 choices for the next element, and 3 choices for the last element.  Write down all 60 of the outcomes you get by counting the <q>subsets</q> this way.<fn>This might seem like a lot of busy work, but your efforts will be rewarded.</fn>

    This suggests a general approach to solving a counting problem.  Say we want to count the number of elements in a set <m>S</m>.  Suppose we can count the size of some set <m>T</m>, perhaps containing many more elements than we are actually interested in counting.  Then define an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>T</m> so that there is a bijection between <m>S</m> and the set of equivalence classes <m>T/\sim</m>.  Then if we know the size of <m>T/\sim</m>, we have the size of <m>S</m>.
  </p>
          <p>
    Look at the notation <m>T/\sim</m> that we used to denote the set of equivalence classes of <m>T</m> under <m>\sim</m>.  This set is sometimes called the <term>quotient set</term> or <term>quotient space</term> of <m>T</m> by <m>\sim</m>.  This is a good name, as you are dividing up a set into parts.  It is also a good name because sometimes we can conclude
    <me>
      |T/\sim| = |T|/|A|
    </me>
    where <m>A</m> is one of the equivalence classes under <m>\sim</m>.  When can you do this?
  </p>
          <p>
    Note this is exactly what we did when we counted subsets: we divided the number of permutations by the number of permutations equivalent to each other.  That worked precisely because <em>all the equivalence classes had the same size</em>!
  </p>
          <p>
    This justifies the <term>quotient principle</term> we now state.

        table? (Assume
        that when people are sitting around a round table, all that really matters is who is to each person's right. For example, if we can get one arrangement of people around the table from another by having everyone get up and move to the right one place and sit back down, we get an equivalent arrangement of people. Notice that you can get a list from a seating arrangement by marking a place at the table, and then listing the people at the table, starting at that place and moving around to the right.) There are at least two different ways of doing this problem. Try to find them both, especially the one that uses the quotient principle.

        The problem suggests that you think about how to get a list from a seating arrangement. Could every list of n distinct people come from a seating chart? How many lists of n distinct people are there? How many lists could we get from a given seating chart by taking different starting places?

            <hint>
              <p>
        For a different way of doing the problem, suppose that you have chosen one person, say the first one in a list of the people in alphabetical order by name. Now seat that person. Does it matter where they sit? In how many ways can you seat the remaining people? Does it matter where the second person in alphabetical order sits?

        The total number of ways to list how the <m>n</m> people sit around the table is <m>n!</m>. However, two lists are the same if we get one from the other by shifting everyone right the same number of places. This divides the set of lists up into sets of <m>n</m> mutually equivalent lists. The number <m>m</m> of such sets is the number of seating arrangements. However by the product principle, <m>mn=n!</m>, because we have partitioned up the set of <m>n!</m> lists into <m>m</m> sets of size <m>n</m>. Therefore <m>m=(n-1)!</m> A second solution may be obtained by choosing one of the <m>n</m> people and letting this person sit anywhere. Since all that matters is who is to the right of each person, it doesn't matter where this person sits. Once this person is seated, let everybody else sit down. If they sit down first in one order clockwise around the table and then in some other order, the person to the right of somebody has changed. Thus there are <m>(n-1)!</m> ways (the number of ways to seat everybody else) to seat the people around the table.

              <p>
        We can partition the permutations according to which necklace designs they create. Two permutations are in the same block if we get one either by circularly permuting the other or by reversing the other (this corresponds to flipping the necklace over in space). Thus each necklace corresponds to <m>2n</m> permutations so by the quotient principle we have <m>n!/2n=(n-1)!/2</m> ways to string <m>n</m> distinct beads on a necklace.

        Using the quotient principle, you can treat each <q>a</q> as distinct to list all <m>7!</m> arrangements.  But then group arrangements if they have their a's in the same positions: there are <m>3!</m> permutations in each block.  So there are <m>\frac{7!}{3!}</m> anagrams.

              <p>
        Another approach is to first pick three of the seven positions for the a's.  This can be done in <m>\binom{7}{3}</m> ways.  Then you must permute the remaining 4 letters in the remaining 4 spots, in <m>4!</m> ways.  This give <m>\binom{7}{3}4!</m> anagrams.

          <title>When does Order Matter?</title>
          <p>
    One way to distinguish combinations from permutations is by asking whether <q>order matters</q>.  Both <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> and <m>P(n,k)</m> count the number of ways to select <m>k</m> objects from <m>n</m> objects without repeats, but you use the combination <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> when <q>order doesn't matter</q> and the permutation <m>P(n,k)</m> when <q>order matters</q>.  Despite the presence of the scare quotes, this is not a false statement, but we must understand what we mean when we say <q>order matters</q>.

    Understanding the role of order in distinguishing outcomes often suggests the use of the quotient principle.  You might say we arrive at combinations by counting permutations and <q>modding</q> out by the order.  Each block that corresponds to a single combination is a group of permutations that are only different because of their order.  Let's see if we can apply this to other counting questions.

          <p>
    The previous activity illustrates that you cannot always simply apply the quotient principle to eliminate order mattering.  What we are after in the 3-scoop shakes with possibly repeated flavors is a <term>multiset</term>, which is just like a set only we allow for elements to be in the set multiple times, but we still do not care in what order the elements are listed.  So an example of an <m>4</m>-element multiset of <m>[7]</m> is <m>\{1,3,3,6\}</m>, which is the same multiset as <m>\{1,6,3,3\}</m> but different from the multiset <m>\{1,3,6\}</m> (in particular, this multiset only has three elements).
  </p>
          <p>
    What we tried to do above was to count multisets by first counting sequences with possibly repeated elements, and then divide out by the number of sequences that just differ by the arrangement of a particular multiset.  But this didn't work, because the size of each block was not the same.
  </p>
          <p>
    However, we would still like to be able to count the number of multisets.  How can we do this?  Is it an application of the quotient principle after all?  To start, let's establish some notation.  The number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[n]</m> was given by <m>n</m> choose <m>k</m> (written <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>), so we will say that the number of <m>k</m>-element <em>multisets</em> of <m>[n]</m> will be <term><m>n</m> multichoose <m>k</m></term>, and write <m>\mchoose{n}{k}</m>.  From what we have seen above, we can say,
    <me>
      \mchoose{n}{k} \ne \frac{n^k}{k!}
    </me>
    despite the obvious allure of this possibility.
  </p>
          <p>
    Our question now is, what <em>should</em> be in the numerator if not <m>n^k</m>?  First let's get more comfortable with thinking of multisets as a model for counting questions.

    The problems in <xref ref="act-distributionintro"/> are sometimes referred to as <q>distribution problems</q>, since we are asking for the number of ways to distribute some objects to some recipients.   This is a useful model for the other counting techniques we have seen as well.  For example, a permutation <m>P(n,k)</m> gives the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> distinct objects to <m>n</m> distinct recipients, so that each recipient gets at most one object.

          <p>
    The claim implicit in <xref ref="act-distributionintro"/> is that the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> identical objects to <m>n</m> distinct recipients (now allowing each recipient to receive any number of objects, including zero) is <m>\mchoose{n}{k}</m>.

      The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function does not determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function.
      More precisely, an <term>ordered function</term><idx><h>ordered function</h></idx><idx><h>function</h><h>ordered</h></idx> from a set <m>S</m> to a set <m>T</m> is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of <m>S</m> to some, but not necessarily all, elements of <m>T</m> in such a way that each element of <m>S</m> appears on one and only one of the lists.<fn>The phrase ordered function is not a standard one, because there is as yet no standard name for the result of an ordered distribution problem.</fn>
    </p>
          <p>
      We often think of functions as a rule that assigns an output to each input.  However, we could equally well specify a function by giving the complete inverse image of each element of the codomain.  That is, to define a (non-ordered) function <m>f:S \to T</m>, we could give the set <m>f\inv(t) = \{s \in S \st f(s) = t\}</m> for each <m>t \in T</m>.  The set of elements sent to <m>t</m> is a <em>set</em> for a function, but for an ordered function, it is a <em>sequence</em>.

            In some sort of manufacturing mishap, your set of magnetic letters contains only the first 7 letters of the alphabet, and for some reason 5 identical exclamation marks.  How many ways can you arrange all 12 magnets in a single line?  (one such line is BG!AD!!!FEC!).

              <solution>
                <p>
            To use the quotient principle, treat the exclamation marks as distinct, and arrange all 12 magnets in <m>12!</m> ways.  Then group lines if the exclamation marks are in the same positions.  There are <m>5!</m> lines in each group, so there are <m>12!/5!</m> groups.
          </p>
                <p>
            Alternatively, you can see this is correct by thinking about picking one of the 12 positions to put the A into, then one of the remaining positions for the B, and so on.  This is <m>P(12,7)</m>, just to put the letters down.  But now you have only one choice as to where to put the exclamation marks.

            Treat each space separated by exclamation marks as a shelf.  So there is a shelf to the left of the first exclamation mark, a shelf between the first and the second, and so on, including a shelf after the last exclamation mark.
          </p>
                <p>
            Physically, you could think of shelving books as first lining up all the books with bookmarks between groups of books.  You then put everything before the first separator on the first shelf, everything between the first and second separator on the second shelf, and so on.

      AHA!  The previous activity suggests that to count multisets, which is the same as counting distributions of identical objects to distinct recipients, we should apply the quotient principle to ordered functions.
    </p>
          <p>
      What should the equivalence relation be?  Think about bookshelves.  An ordered function is a distribution of distinct books to distinct shelves.  A multiset is a distribution of identical books to distinct shelves.  So we want two ordered functions to be equivalent if their corresponding shelves contain the same number of books (we no longer care what those books are, just how many there are).
    </p>
          <p>
      Now, given any ordered function, how many ordered functions are in its equivalence class?  We can get any other element in the class by permuting the books (but keeping the numbers in each shelf constant).  There are <m>k</m> books, so there are <m>k!</m> ways to permute them.  This is the same for <em>every</em> ordered function, so the equivalence classes all have the same size.
    </p>
          <p>
      Applying the quotient principle, we arrive at the following.
    </p>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-multisetsize">

          The number of <m>k</m>-element multisets of <m>[n]</m> is

          <p>
      It is interesting that the number of <m>k</m>-element multisets of <m>[n]</m> can be expressed as a binomial coefficient.  This suggests there should be a way to describe a multiset as choosing <m>k</m> things from a collection of <m>n-1+k</m> things. Or perhaps thinking about each multiset as a <m>(n-1+k)</m>-bit string of weight <m>k</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      There is a standard interpretation for this.  We call this approach <term>stars and bars</term> (others use <em>balls and wall</em> or <em>dashes and slashes</em>; the important thing is that it rhymes).  The idea is that we represent each multiset as a string of <m>k</m> <q>stars</q> and <m>n-1</m> <q>bars</q>.  These are really just bit strings in disguise, so the binomial coefficient becomes clear.  The only question is how do multisets correspond to the strings?

                This is backwards.
                We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical,
                but the stars are.
                Instead we should use 5 stars
                (for the lollipops)
                and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids.
                For example,
                <me>
                  **||***|||
                </me>
                would
                represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops,
                the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.

              <p>
                This doesn't represent a solution.
                Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should
                <em>switch</em>
                between the different variables.
                We have one too many bars.

        equation cries out for a combinatorial explanation. Here it is.
        Imagine lining up the <m>k</m> books in a row. Then there are
        <m>k-1</m> places in between them. Choose <m>n-1</m> of these
        places, and slide a piece of paper in there as a divider. Now put
        the books before the first divider on shelf one, and the books after
        divider <m>i</m> on shelf <m>i+1</m>. This gives an arrangement of
        the books on the shelves so that every shelf has a book!

    The previous activity is an example of what we might call an <term>ordered surjection</term>.  Just like we did with ordered functions, we can apply the quotient principle to count distributions where the objects being distributed are no longer distinct.

    So far, we have only considered distribution problems in which the recipients are distinct.  There are plenty of situations where we would want to consider recipients identical.  For example, a problem we will take up in <xref ref="ch_advanced"/> is how many ways we can partition an integer.  For example, we could partition 5 as <m>4+1</m> or <m>3+1+1</m>, but we would not want to also count <m>1+4</m> or <m>1+3+1</m> (doing so would be creating a <em>composition</em>, which we have already considered).  We can think of the integer partition problem as distributing the 5 units that make up 5 into some number of identical bins.

          <p>
    Here is another example, which we already have the tools to address.

              <p>
        We can make a list of the <m>k</m> distinct books in <m>k!</m> ways. Then we have to choose <m>n-1</m> of the <m>k-1</m> places between the lists as the places where we will break the list.

      </p>

        Alternately, we can take the number of ways to put <m>k</m> books onto <m>n</m> bookshelves so that each shelf gets at least one, and then divide by the number of shelves factorial. That gives us <m>k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!</m> ways to arrange the books.

    We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in <xref ref="brokenpermutation"/>. Instead of dividing a set up into non-overlapping parts, we may think of dividing a <em>permutation</em> (thought of as a list) of our <m>k</m> objects up into <m>n</m> ordered blocks.

        <title>Counting with Recursion</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
    What happens when you get stuck on a counting problem?  It is quite easy to miss the clever way of thinking about breaking down a task that leads to a solution.  Here is an example.
  </p>
          <p>
    Your favorite milk-shake diner has 11 stools along the bar.  Patrons of the diner have a rule that no two adjacent stools can be simultaneously occupied.  In how many ways can the stools be occupied by any number of patrons (including no patrons at all, leaving all stools unoccupied)?
  </p>
          <p>
    A first attempt might be to start with stool 1 and realize that it can be sat on or not.  So there are two choices for stool 1.  But now you might have two choices for stool 2 (if stool 1 was not sat on) or only once choice (to keep stool 2 empty, if stool 1 was in use).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.
  </p>
          <p>
    Say you can't think of anything else to try.  The problem seems just too hard.  So make it easier:  11 is way too big of a number; 1 would be much better.  How many ways could a row of 1 stool be occupied?  Let's call this number <m>S_1</m>.  Maybe then we also try the version with 2 and 3 stools.

    Given any graph <m>G = (V, E)</m>, an <term>independent set</term> (of vertices) is a subset <m>I \subseteq V</m> so that no two vertices in <m>I</m> are adjacent.  Suppose you wished to count the number of independent sets of a particular graph.  In this example, lets do so for the path <m>P_{10}</m> (i.e., the graph containing 11 vertices and 10 edges arranged in a line).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's label the vertices 1 through 11, and assume that vertices are adjacent to those with labels one more or one less than themselves (that is, the edge set is <m>E = \{(i,i+1) \st 1 \le i \lt 11\}</m>).  How might you build an independent set?
  </p>

  <p>
    A first attempt might be to start with vertex 1 and realize that you can put it in or keep it out of the independent set.  So there are two choices for vertex 1.  But now you might have two choices for vertex 2 (if vertex 1 was not in the set) or only once choice (to keep vertex 2 out, if vertex 1 was in the set).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.

  Once we have a proof that our sequence really does give the answers to all the versions of the counting question we are interested in, then  we can start investigating properties of this sequence.  Sometimes, we might even be able to find a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence, so we can compute values without relying on the recurrence.
</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="subsec-recursionfinding">
          <title>Finding Recurrence Relations</title>
          <p>
    Before investigating properties of sequences given by recurrence relations, we must be able to find those sequences and the recurrence relations.  The following activities give some practice with moving from a counting question to a recurrence relation for the sequence of answers.  You might be able to answer the counting questions with what we have already discovered, but do not do this.  The point of these is to start thinking about these counting problems recursively.
  </p>
          <p>
    First, here is an example of what we are looking for.
  </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
        Let <m>a_n</m> be the number of subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 0}</m>.  Prove the recurrence relation is correct.
      </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <hint>
      <p>
        You should ask yourself, how are the subsets of <m>[n]</m> related to the subsets of <m>[n-1]</m>.  If you are stuck, you could always <q>cheat</q> and use your knowledge of the value of <m>a_n</m>, but try to do this without thinking about that.
      </p>
    </hint> -->
            <solution>
              <p>
        Start by enumerating the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 0}</m>.  There is only 1 subset of the empty set (so <m>a_0 = 1</m>).  There are two subsets of <m>[1]</m>, and four subsets of <m>[2]</m>.  So the sequence looks like <m>1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots</m>.  It <em>appears</em> that the recurrence relation should be <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with initial condition <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
      </p>
              <p>
        To prove this is correct, we <em>must</em> reference the things we are counting (saying that the recurrence agrees with the finitely many terms we have listed is NOT enough).  Consider the <m>a_{n-1}</m> different subsets of <m>[n-1]</m>.  Each of these is a subset of <m>[n]</m>, in particular, a subset of <m>[n]</m> that does not include the number <m>n</m> as an element.  Further, to each of these sets, we can add the element <m>n</m> to get another distinct subset of <m>[n]</m>.  So far, we have found <m>2a_{n-1}</m> subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Actually, we have found all of them: every subset of <m>[n]</m> either includes <m>n</m> or it does not.

        The <q>Towers of Hanoi</q> puzzle has three rods rising from a rectangular base with <m>n</m> rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod.

        We can solve the puzzle in one step if there is one ring, so <m>m_1=1</m>. If <m>n&gt;0</m> and we want to move all the rings from the initial rod to rod 3, then first we solve the problem of moving all but the bottom ring to rod 2; this takes <m>m_{n-1}</m> steps, then we move the bottom ring to rod 3, then we solve the problem of moving all the remaining rings from rod 2 to rod 3.

        We draw <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles in the plane so that each one crosses each other one exactly twice and no three intersect in the same point. (As examples, think of Venn diagrams with two or three mutually intersecting sets.) Find a recurrence for the number <m>r_n</m> of regions into which the plane is divided by <m>n</m> circles. (One circle divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside.) Find the number of regions with <m>n</m> circles. For what values of <m>n</m> can you draw a Venn diagram showing all the possible intersections of <m>n</m> sets using circles to represent each of the sets?

        If we have <m>n - 1</m> circles drawn in such a way that they define <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and we draw a new circle, each time it crosses another circle, except for the last time, it finishes dividing one region into two parts and starts dividing a new region into two parts.

            <solution>
              <p>
        One circle defines two regions, the inside and outside. When we draw a second circle that intersects the first, we can start at one of the intersection points and go inside the first circle, cutting its region into two pieces, and then when we leave it we cut the outside region into two pieces. This suggests the general pattern. If we have drawn <m>n-1</m> circles and start a new one, each time we enter a circle, we start dividing a region into two pieces. Each time we leave a circle, we also start dividing a region into two pieces. 
        Thus if we have <m>r_n</m> regions with <m>n</m> circles, to get the number of regions, we note that in going from <m>n-1</m> circles to <m>n</m> circles, we start with <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and divide <m>2(n-1)</m> of them in half, so we get <m>2n-2</m> new regions. This gives us <m>r_n=r_{n-1}+2(n-1)</m>. 
        Notice that by substitution of the formula <m>r_{n-1}=r_{n-2} +2(n-2)</m>, we get <m>r_n=r_{n-2}+ 2(n-2) +2(n-1)</m>, and would guess that <m>r_n=r_{n-3}+2(n-3)+2(n-2) +2(n-1)</m>. This leads to the conjecture <me>   r_n=r_1  +2\cdot1+2\cdot2+\cdots+2\cdot(n-1)=r_1+2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}   i=2+n(n-1). </me>
      </p>
              <p>
        We can prove this formula by induction. When <m>n=1</m> we have <m>2+1\cdot0</m> regions. Assuming that <m>n-1</m> circles give us <m>2+(n-1)(n-2)</m> regions, for <m>n</m> circles we have <m>2+(n-1)(n-2) +2(n-1)=2+n(n-1)</m> regions. Thus the correctness of our formula for <m>n-1</m> circles implies its correctness when we have <m>n</m> circles, so for all positive integers <m>n</m>, we get <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions determined by <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles. Two circles cannot touch more than twice, and if we let some of our <m>n</m> circles touch just once, or not at all, that would reduce the number of regions we would get.
        Similarly, allowing a circle to go through the intersection point of two other circles could only reduce the number of regions. So with <m>n</m> circles we could never have more than <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions. In particular with 4 circles we get just 14 regions, rather than the 16 that would be required in a Venn diagram for four sets. We could prove, again by induction, that <m>2+n(n-1)\lt 2^n</m> for all <m>n&gt;3</m>, so it is not possible to draw a Venn diagram using circles to illustrate the intersections of four or more sets.

        If you write out the sequence, it would be easy to guess at a closed formula, but the point here is to <em>use</em> the recurrence relation somehow.  Consider rewriting the recurrence relation as <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2</m>.  Note that <m>a_n - a_0 = (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) + \cdots + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_0)</m>.

    The sequence in <xref ref="act-arithmetic"/> is an example of an <term>arithmetic sequence</term> (or arithmetic progression) in that the difference between terms is constant.  The sequence in <xref ref="act-geometric"/> is an example of a <term>geometric sequence</term> (or geometric progression) because the <em>ratio</em> between terms is constant.

          <p>
    The techniques used to get those closed formulas are also worth pointing out.  The method suggested in the hint to <xref ref="act-arithmetic"/> is called <term>telescoping</term> and the method suggested for <xref ref="act-geometric"/> is called <term>iteration</term>.

    Most sequences are not arithmetic, but it is still helpful to look at the difference between terms.  Often if we know something about the sequence of differences, we can deduce something about the original sequence.   We can also think about this as starting with the sequence of differences.

        Given a sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> with a quadratic closed formula, say <m>b_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>, what will the closed formula for the sequence of differences be?  That is, what is the closed formula for <m>a_n = b_n - b_{n-1}</m>?  Why does this show that every quadratic sequence is the sequence of partial sums for some arithmetic sequence?

    The above observations can be generalized: a cubic sequence will have quadratic difference, a quartic sequence will have cubic differences, and so on.  This allows us to guess at the <em>form</em> of a closed formula for a polynomial sequence by taking successive differences.  If the <q>third differences</q> of a sequence are constant, then we would guess we could find a cubic polynomial.  Given the first 4 terms, we can fit the cubic to them by setting up a system of 4 equations and 4 unknowns.

        Now subtract: <m>2S - S = -3 + 24576 = 24573</m>.
        Since <m>2S - S = S</m>, we have our answer.

    each term becomes the next term.
    We shift over the sum to get the subtraction to mostly cancel out,
    leaving just the first term and new last term.

        The only real difference is that we are now computing an
        <em>infinite</em> geometric sum,
        we do not have the extra <q>last</q> term to consider.
        Really, this is the result of taking a limit as you would in calculus when you compute

    This is a partial justification of the <term>characteristic root technique</term> (the polynomial whose roots are the base of the exponentials is called the <term>characteristic polynomial</term>).  Making the reasonable guess that recurrence relations which give <m>a_n</m> as a linear combination of <m>a_{n-1}</m> and <m>a_{n-2}</m> should have exponential closed formulas allows you to find the bases of those exponentials.  You can then use the initial conditions to find the constants <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>.  Let's illustrate this process with an example.

        This has roots <m>x = 4</m> and <m>x = -1</m>.  So we guess that the closed formula for <m>a_n</m> will be <m>a_n = \alpha 4^n + \beta (-1)^n</m>.
      </p>
              <p>
        To find <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>, we use the initial conditions.   When <m> n = 1</m> we have <m> 3 = 4\alpha -\beta</m>.  When <m>n = 2</m> we have <m> 13 = 16\alpha + \beta</m>.  It is easy to solve this system of two equations and two unknowns (simply adding them together eliminates the <m>\beta</m>).  We find <m>\alpha = \frac{4}{5}</m> and <m>\beta = \frac{1}{5}</m>.

          <title>Exploring the Fibonacci Sequence</title>
          <p>
    Even though we are thinking of sequences as a tool for solving counting questions, it is often very rewarding to step back and observe the beauty and elegance of a sequence in its own right.  So to conclude this section, we will consider a few delightful observations about the most famous recursively defined sequence: the Fibonacci numbers.
  </p>
          <p>
    For consistency, let's agree that <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number, where <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m>, and for all other <m>n</m>, <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m>.
  </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
        Determine a formula for the sum <m>F_{0} + F_{1} + F_{2} + \ldots + F_{n}</m>.
      </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
        If we collect some initial data we see that the sequence of partial sums is <m>0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, \ldots</m>.  We might recognize these numbers as always one less than a Fibonacci number, and guess that 
        <me>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdot + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1.</me>
      </p>
              <p>
        We could prove this by induction, but for fun, here is a clever observation that finishes the problem: <m>F_k = F_{k+2} - F_{k+1}</m> (just rearrange the recurrence relation).  Now replace each term after <m>F_0</m>:
        <me> F_0 + (F_3 - F_2) + (F_4 - F_3) + (F_5 - F_4) + \cdots + (F_{n+1} - F_n)+ (F_{n+2} - F_{n+1})</me>.
        Almost every term cancels (telescopes) leaving only 
        <me>-F_1 + F_{n+2}</me>
        which is of course what we are looking for.

      The counting problems in <xref first="act-lowerpaths" last="act-rootedtrees">Activities</xref> are not supposed to be easy to solve, but you have a lot of combinatorial tools to try.  Say as much as you can about as many as you can before moving on.  At the very least, you should answer the counting problems for small values of <m>n</m> by writing out the set of outcomes.  In <xref ref="subsec-catalanseq"/>, we will investigate the problems in more depth and see how to answer them fully.

          simply scan through and see the <em>first</em> time the H's dominate the

          <title>The Catalan Numbers</title>
          <p>
      The sequence of Catalan numbers, named after Eugene Catalan who along with Euler discovered many of the properties of these numbers, is the sequence <m>(C_n)_{n \ge 0}</m> starting, <me>1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, \ldots</me>. All of the counting problems above should be answered by Catalan numbers.  Let's investigate this sequence and discover some of its properties.
    </p>
          <p>
      First, we should make sure that at the very least, all of the counting problems above have the same answer.  This will be hugely helpful, since then we could use any of them as a model to discuss the sequence.
    </p>
          <p>
      How do you prove that two counting problems have the same answer?  The bijection principle tells us that if there is a bijection between two sets, then the sets have the same size.  So let's find some bijections.
    </p>
          <example xml:id="act-pathshdseq">
            <statement>
              <p>
          Find a bijection between the set of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that do not rise above the line <m>y = x</m> (as in <xref ref="act-lowerpaths"/>) and the set of ways that the movie patrons in <xref ref="act-hdseq"/> can line up.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <hint>
        <p>
          How could you represent the lattice path using strings of two symbols?  What makes such a path acceptable?
        </p>
      </hint> -->
            <solution>
              <p>
          Represent each lattice path as a string of R's and U's.  Represent each way that the movie patrons can line up as a string of H's and D's.  The bijection will send each R to an H and each U to a D.
        </p>
              <p>
          We need to verify that this bijection is both well defined, and that its inverse is well defined (that the function is injective and surjective).  The key to all of these is to consider what makes a string valid in each case.
        </p>
              <p>
        First, notice that the lattice paths must have an equal number of R's and U's.  Similarly, the string of movie patrons must have an equal number of H's and D's. 
        Further, every initial substring of R's and U's must have at least as many R's as U's, so that the path does not go above the line <m>y=x</m>.  Similarly, the every initial substring of H's and D's (half dollars and dollars) must have at least as many H's as D's, so that change can always be given.  The H's and R's must <em>dominate</em>.
        </p>
              <p>
          The the conditions on what makes a string valid match up, so every string in one set will match up with exactly one string in the other.
        </p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
      Representing the set of outcomes as strings of sequences is useful, because it suggests a bijection between different types of problems.  The strings of paths and movie theater lines from <xref ref="act-pathshdseq"/> are called <term>Dyck words</term>.  These are strings of an equal number of two symbols, say <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, such that no initial segment of the string has more <m>y</m>'s than <m>x</m>'s.
    </p>
          <p>
      We will now see that the number of Dyck words of length <m>2n</m> is <m>C_n</m>.

            Look at rooted binary trees.  What happens when you remove the root?  You could also use the parenthesizing model by asking where <q>main product</q> occurs.
          </p>
              </hint>
              <solution>
                <p>
            We know that the Catalan numbers count the number of rooted binary trees.  Specifically, the number of rooted binary trees with <m>n+2</m> leaves is <m>C_{n+1}</m>.  Thus we must simply argue that the number of rooted binary trees with <m>n+2</m> leaves is also
            <me>
              \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_iC_{n-i} = C_0C_{n} + C_1C_{n-1} + \cdots + C_{n}C_0.
            </me>
          </p>
                <p>
            To see this, consider the result of removing the root of a rooted binary tree.  This results in two more trees (the left and right child of the root are the new roots).  These will either be rooted binary trees, or a single vertex (in the case that one of the children of the root was a leaf already).  There are <m>n+1</m> cases: the left tree is just the root (so the right tree has <m>n+1</m> leaves), the left tree has 2 leaves (so the right tree has <m>n</m> leaves), the left tree has 3 leaves (so the right tree has <m>n-1</m> leaves), and so on until the case where the left tree has <m>n+1</m> leaves (and the right tree is just the root).
          </p>
                <p>
            Each of these cases corresponds to a term in the sum.  When the left tree has <m>i+1</m> leaves, it could be any of <m>C_{i}</m> trees, and for each, the right tree could be any of <m>C_{n-i}</m> trees (they all have <m>n+2-(i+1) = n-i+1</m> leaves).  Using the product and then sum prinicple, we get the right hand side of the recurrence.

Now fix a side the of polygon and consider each of the <m>n+1</m> non-incident vertices.  For each vertex, we can form exactly one triangle that has our fixed side as a side.  The other two sides of this triangle will create two new polygons with the other sides of the original polygon (perhaps the polygon will only have 1 side, if the vertex is chosen adjacent to the fixed side).  These will give you your terms in the sum on the right hand side.

            Explain why the number of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that <em>do</em> cross the line <m>y = x</m> is the same as the number of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that touch or cross the line <m>y = x + 1</m>.

                <p>
            If a lattice path between <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(n,n)</m> goes outside the
            triangle, it can only do so on an up-step. (A step from <m>(i,j)</m> to
            <m>(i,j+1)</m>.) And an up-step must originate at a point with integer
            coordinates. If <m>j\lt i</m> an up-step from <m>(i,j))</m> cannot leave the triangle.
            Thus to leave the triangle, the up-step must leave from a point of the form
            <m>(i,i)</m>, and go to <m>(i,i+1)</m>, which is on the line <m>y=x+1</m>.

        Given a path from <m>(0, 0)</m> to <m>(n, n)</m> which touches or crosses the line <m>y = x + 1</m>,
        how can you modify the part of the path from <m>(0, 0)</m> to the first touch of <m>y = x + 1</m> so that the modified path starts instead at <m>(-1, 1)</m>? The trick is to do this in a systematic way that will give you your bijection.
          </p>
              </hint>
              <solution>
                <p>Suppose we have a lattice path form <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> which touches or crosses the line <m>y=x+1</m>. Let <m>(k,k+1)</m> be the first point on the line <m>y=x+1</m> that the lattice path touches. From that point, work backwards, replacing every up-step with a step one unit to the left and every right-step with a step one unit down. The segment of the path you just changed will have moved left <m>k+1</m> times, so its leftmost <m>x</m> coordinate will be <m>-1</m>, and it will have moved down <m>k</m> times, so its lowest <m>y</m> coordinate will be 1.  Thus we now have a lattice path from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>. Further, given a lattice path from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>, it must cross the line <m>y=x+1</m> at least once, because it starts above the line and ends below it. At the first point where such a path touches the line <m>y=x+1</m>, say <m>(k',k'+1)</m>, work backwards replacing every up-step with a step to the left and every right-step with a step downward. The leftmost point on this path will have <m>x</m> coordinate 0, and the lowest point will have <m>y</m> coordinate 0, so the new path will be a lattice path from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that touches the line <m>y=x+1</m>. Clearly these two processes reverse each other, and so they give us a bijection between paths form <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m> that touch the line <m>y=x+1</m> and lattice lattice paths from <m>(-1,1)</m> to <m>(n,n)</m>. Notice that geometrically what we are doing to get the bijection is to take the portion of a lattice path that goes from the initial point till the first touch of the line <m>y=x+1</m> and reflecting it around that line. This idea of reflection was introduced by Feller, and is called Feller's reflection principle.

      <introduction>
        <p>
  The combinatorics we have investigated so far has been <em>nice</em>.  While not always immediately obvious, each problem had an answer in a nice form that, once you saw how to think about it the right way, could be expressed with a closed formula.
</p>
        <p>
  Not all of combinatorics is like this.  There are natural questions for which we do not have neat closed formulas.  This might be because we (mathematicians) have not yet figured out how to think about these problems in the <q>right</q> way, or because there is really no clean approach to solve these problems.
</p>
        <p>
  But lack of clean solutions does not mean the problems have no answer.  Rather, we must simply look for more abstract techniques before we can get any hold on them.
</p>
        <p>
  The plan for this chapter is as follows.  We will start with two combinatorial tools.  First, the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion  and then generating functions.   We will then consider some natural extensions of distribution problems first introduced in <xref ref="sec_basic-quotient"/>: partitioning sets and integers.

        <title>The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion: the Size of a Union</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
        One of our very first counting
        principles was the <term>sum principle</term><idx><h>sum principle</h></idx> which says that
        the size of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes.
        Computing the size of overlapping sets requires, quite naturally,
        information about how they overlap. Taking such information into account
        will allow us to develop a powerful extension of the sum principle known

        The difficulty of generalizing <xref ref="threesetintersection"/> and
        <xref ref="nsetintersection"/> is not likely to be one of being able to
        see what the right conjecture is, but of finding a good notation to
        express your conjecture. In fact, it would be easier for some people to
        express the conjecture in words than to express it in a notation. Here
        is some notation that will make your task easier. Let us define
        <me>
          \bigcap_{i:i\in I}A_i
        </me>
        to mean the intersection over all elements <m>i</m>
        in the set <m>I</m> of
        <m>A_i</m>. Thus
        <men xml:id="intersectionnotation">
          \bigcap_{i:i\in
          \{1,3,4,6\}} = A_1\cap A_3\cap A_4 \cap A_6.
        </men>
      </p>
          <p>
        This kind of notation, consisting of an operator with a description
        underneath of the values of a dummy variable of interest to us, can be
        extended in many ways. For example
        <mdn><mrow number="no">\sum_{I:I \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}, \ |I|=2} |\cap_{i\in I}
          A_i|  \amp =  |A_1\cap A_2|+ |A_1\cap A_3|
           +|A_1\cap A_4|</mrow><mrow xml:id="notationsolution"> \amp +  |A_2\cap A_3|+
          |A_2\cap A_4| +|A_3\cap A_4|.</mrow></mdn>

            Use notation something like that of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equation</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution">Equation</xref> to express
            the answer to <xref ref="nsetintersection"/>. Note there are many
            different correct ways to do this problem. Try to write down more
            than one and choose the nicest one you can. Say why you chose it
            (because your view of what makes a formula nice may be different from
            somebody else's). The nicest formula won't necessarily involve all the
            elements of <xref ref="intersectionnotation">Equations</xref> and <xref ref="notationsolution"/>.

            S\not=\emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1}|\bigcap_{i: i\in S}A_i|
          </me>
            I chose this
            way of writing the formula partly because it is efficient with symbols;
            for example, it uses only one sum sign. But more importantly I chose it
            because it captures what I would want to say in words: ``You sum, over
            all ways of choosing an intersection of the sets <m>A_i</m>, the size of the
            intersection times a sign factor that is -1 if you are intersecting
            an even number of sets and 1 if you are intersecting an odd number."
            If I were writing my solution out in words, I would probably assume
            that nobody would think about the possibility of an intersection of the
            empty set of the
            <m>A_i</m>s, but I had to put the <m>S\not=\emptyset</m> in my formula because
            otherwise the formula would have had us consider the possibility that
            <m>S</m> was empty.

        Whether we try to write down a nice expression for the size of a union or whether we just have the basic idea, we should now be able to answer counting questions like the following.  We will return to this sort of problem in more detail later, but the adventurous reader can attempt it here.

              If we let <m>A_i</m> be the set of backpack distributions in which student

              That is, we need to know the number of ways to pass out the backpacks
              so that student <m>i</m> gets the correct one for each <m>i</m> in <m>S</m>. It
              won't matter whether or not other students get the correct backpacks,

        handing back the backpacks as a permutation <m>f</m> of the students: <m>f(i)</m> is
        the owner of the backpack that student <m>i</m> receives. Then a derangement
        is a way to pass back the backpacks so that no student gets his or her
        own.

          <title>The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion</title>
          <p>
        The formula you have given in <xref ref="inclusion-exclusionunion"/> is
        often called <term>the principle of inclusion and
        exclusion</term><idx><h>inclusion and exclusion principle
        </h><h>for unions of sets</h></idx><idx><h>principle of inclusion and exclusion</h><h>for
        unions of sets</h></idx> for unions of sets. The reason is the pattern in which
        the formula first adds (includes) all the sizes of the sets, then
        subtracts (excludes) all the sizes of the intersections of two sets, then
        adds (includes) all the sizes of the intersections of three sets, and so
        on.   Notice that we haven't yet proved the principle. There are a variety of proofs.  Perhaps one of the most straightforward (though not the most elegant) is an inductive proof that relies on the fact that
        <me>
          A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n
        </me>
        and the formula for the size of a union of two sets: <m>\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A\cap B}</m>.

              <p>
            The principle of inclusion and exclusion for one set says <m>|A_1| = |A_1|</m>.  The principle of inclusion and exclusion for two sets says <m>|A_1\cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2|</m>, and was prove in our solution to <xref ref="twosetintersection"/>.  Now suppose the formula is true for a union of <m>n-1</m> or fewer sets and <m>n \ge 2</m>.  Since
            <me>
              A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n
            </me>
            we can apply the formula of <xref ref="twosetintersection"/> to get

            <md><mrow> \left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| \amp = \left|\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i\right) \cup A_n \right| </mrow><mrow> \amp = \left| \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i\right| + |A_n| - \left|\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i\right) \cap A_n\right|</mrow><mrow> \amp = \left| \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i\right| + |A_n| - \left|\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i \cap A_n\right|</mrow></md>

            By the inductive hypothesis, we may apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion to the first and last term in the last line above, and can rewrite it as
            <md><mrow>
            \sum_{S:S\subseteq [n-1],S\ne \emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}\left|\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i \right| + |A_n| - \sum_{S:S\subseteq [n-1],S\ne \emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}\left|\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i \cap A_n \right|
            </mrow><mrow>
            = \sum_{S:S\subseteq [n],S\ne \emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}\left|\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i \right|,
            </mrow></md>
            where the last line follows because every nonempty subset of <m>[n]</m> is either (1) a nonempty subset of <m>[n-1]</m>, (2) a nonempty subset of <m>[n-1]</m> with  <m>n</m> added in, or (3) the set <m>\{n\}</m>.  Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, the formula for the principle of inclusion and exclusion holds for all nonnegative integers <m>n</m>.

            </solution>
          </exploration>
          <p>
            Frequently when we apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we will have a situation like that of part (d) of <xref ref="hatcheckprobpart"/>.  That is, we will have a set <m>A</m> and subsets <m>A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n</m> and we will want the size or the probability of the set of elements in <m>A</m> that are <em>not</em> in the union.  This set is known as the <term>complement</term> <idx><h>complement</h></idx> of the union of the <m>A_i</m>s in <m>A</m>, and is denoted by <m>A \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i</m>, or if <m>A</m> is clear from context, by <m>\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since all the <m>A_i</m>s are subsets of <m>A</m>, one way to write this size is as <m>|A| - \sum_{S:S \subseteq [n], S \ne \emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1} |\bigcap_{i:i \in S}A_i|</m>.  Letting <m>|A| = \left|\bigcap_{i:i \in \emptyset} A_i\right|</m>, we may write <m>\left|\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\right| = \sum_{S:S \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|S|}\left| \bigcap_{i:i\in S} A_i\right|</m>.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            We can find a very elegant way of writing the formula in <xref ref="nsetintersection"/> if we let <m>\bigcap_{i:i\in\emptyset}A_i = A</m>.  for this reason, if we have a family of subsets <m>A_i</m> of a set <m>A</m>, we define<fn>
            For those interested in logic and set theory, given a family of subsets <m>A_i</m> of a set <m>A</m>, we define <m>\bigcap_{i:i\in S}A_i</m> to be the set of all members <m>x</m> of <m>A</m> that are in <m>A_i</m> for all <m>i \in S</m>.  (Note that this allows <m>x</m> to be in some other <m>A_j</m>s as well.)  Then if <m>S = \emptyset</m>, our intersection consists of all members <m>x</m> of <m>A</m> that satisfy the statement <q>if <m>i\in \emptyset</m>, then <m>x \in A_i</m>.</q>
            But since the hypothesis of the <q>if-then</q> statement is false, the statement itself is true for all <m>x \in A</m>.  Therefore <m>\bigcap_{i:i \in \emptyset}A_i = A</m>.
          </fn> <m>\bigcap_{i:i\in\emptyset}A_i = A</m>.
        </p> -->
          <p>
            The principle of inclusion and exclusion generally refers to both this formula and the one for the union.  Both formulas are notationally horrific, but the idea is straight forward.  To find the size of the union, we add the sizes of each set individually, then subtract each of the sizes of the intersections of pairs of sets, then add back in the sizes of the intersections of triples of sets, subtract 4-tuple intersections, add 5-tuple intersections, and so on until we are done.  The compliment can be calculated by subtracting the union from the size of the original set.

          Notice that it is straightforward to figure out how many ways we may pass
          out the apples so that child <m>i</m> gets five or more apples: give five apples to
          child <m>i</m> and then pass out the remaining apples however you choose. And if  we want to figure out how many ways we may pass out the apples so that a given set <m>C</m> of children each get five or more apples, we give five to each child in <m>C</m> and then pass out the remaining <m>k-5|C|</m> apples however we choose.

                Let <m>S</m> be the set of all distributions of <m>k</m> identical apples to the <m>n</m> children. Let <m>A_i</m> be the set of distributions in which child <m>i</m> gets five or more apples. Then
              we are asking for the number of distributions of apples that lie in none of the sets, so we are asking for <m>|\overline{A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots \cup A_n}|</m>. From the formula you gave in
              <xref ref="nsetintersection"/> we see that to find this number we need to know
              <m>|\bigcap_{i\in S}A_i|</m> for every subset <m>S</m> of <m>[n]</m>. But if
              <m>S</m> has size <m>s</m>, then <m>S</m> determines a distribution such that all the children in a particular set of size <m>s</m> will get five or more apples. We can pass out the apples so that the children in a particular set
              <m>\hat S</m> of children get at least five apples as follows: we give everyone in <m>\hat
              S</m> five apples, and then pass out the remaining <m>k-5s</m> apples to the
              children in <m>\binom{k-5s+n-1}{k-5s}= \binom{k-5s+n-1}{n-1}</m> ways. This
              counts the number of ways to give at least five apples to every child in
              <m>\hat S</m>, and maybe give five apples to some other children as well. Thus
              <m>|\bigcap_{i\in S}A_i| = = \binom{k-5|S|+n-1}{n-1}</m>. In particular, if <m>S=\emptyset</m>, we get <m>\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}</m>, which is the total number of ways to pass out <m>k</m> identical apples to <m>n</m> children.

We are interested in <m>|\overline{A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots \cup A_n}|</m>. Thus, for a set <m>S\subseteq [n]</m>, we need to compute <m>\left|\bigcup_{i\colon i\in S} A_i\right|</m>. If we let each couple described by <m>S</m> sit together,
            we will seat <m>|S|</m> couples and <m>2n-2|S|</m> individuals around the table. We
            can do this in <m>2^{|S|}(|S| + 2n-2 |S|-1)!</m> ways, because once we chose a
            place for a couple (<ie/>, two adjacent seats) there are two ways the couple
            can sit down. Thus as long as <m>S</m> is nonempty, we have the right formula for <m>\left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i\right|</m>. Notice that in the case where <m>S=\emptyset</m> the formula gives us <m>(2n-1)!</m> seating arrangements, which is exactly the number of ways to seat <m>2n</m> people around a round table.

              </hint>
              <solution>
                <p>
            We are going to consider arrangements of the couples alternating
            sex around the table. This will be our set <m>A</m>. The set <m>A_i</m> is the set of arrangements in which couple <m>i</m> sits together. We are interested in the number of arrangements that are in none of these sets. Thus for each subset <m>S</m> of <m>[n]</m>, we consider the number of arrangements in <m>\displaystyle\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i</m>. We distinguish the case that <m>S</m> is empty from the
            others. The number of arrangements with <m>S</m> empty is just the number of ways to seat <m>2n</m>
            couples around the table, alternating sex, but with no other
            restrictions. We can arrange one of the sexes in a circle in <m>n-1!</m> ways
            and then assign the members of the opposite sex to the places between them
            in <m>n!</m> ways, so <m>\displaystyle \left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in \emptyset} A_i \right| = (n-1)!n!</m>. (Another way to
            get this result is to let one person sit down. This determines the sex
            of the person at each place of the table, so there are <m>(n-1)!</m> ways to
            assign the people of the same sex of the first person, and <m>n!</m> ways to
            assign the people of the opposite. It appears that there are <m>2n</m>
            choices for where the first person sits, but we can break the seating
            charts up into blocks of <m>2n</m> seating charts, each of which gives the
            same circular arrangement. Thus there are <m>(n-1)!n!</m> inequivalent seating arrangments.)
          </p>
                <p>
            Now if
            <m>S</m> is nonempty, and has <m>s</m> members, we seat one of the couples that must
            sit together (say the first in alphabetical order), and this determines the
            sex of the person that must sit at each other place. There are <m>2n</m> pairs
            of adjacent seats where we can seat that couple and two ways they can sit
            in the pair of adjacent seats that we choose. Then we have <m>s-1</m> couples,
            <m>n-s</m> men and <m>n-s</m> women to seat in the remaining places. First we
            arrange the <m>s-1</m> couples and <m>2n-2s</m> identical empty chairs in places at
            the table in <m>(2n-2s+s-1)!/(2n-2s)!=(2n-s-1)!/(2n-2s)!</m> ways. Each couple
            can sit in only one way in the places they have chosen, because the sex of
            the person in a given place has been determined by how the first couple
            sits. The sex of the person in each of the remaining chairs has been
            determined, so we assign the men to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways and we
            assign the women to their seats in <m>(n-s)!</m> ways. Thus we have
            <m>2\cdot2n(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2/(2n-2s)!</m> ways to place the people. But we can
            partition the placements into blocks of <m>2n</m> equivalent placements,
            because shifting everyone the same number of places to the right or left
            gives an equivalent placement. Thus the number of inequivalent seating
            arrangements is
            <md><mrow>\frac{2(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2}{(2n-2s)!} =\amp \frac{2(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!^2}{2(n-s)(2n-2s-1)!}</mrow><mrow> =\amp \frac{(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!(n-s-1)!}{(2n-2s-1)!}.</mrow></md>
          </p>
                <p>
            Notice that
            if we take
            <m>s=0</m>, this formula reduces to <m>(n-1)!n!</m>. Thus for all sets <m>S</m>
            <me>
              \left|\bigcap_{i\colon i\in S} A_i\right|=\frac{(2n-s-1)!(n-s)!(n-s-1)!}{(2n-2s-1)!}

        A <term>derangement</term><idx><h>derangement</h></idx> of <m>n</m> elements <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}</m> is a permutation in which no element is fixed. For example, there are <m>6</m> permutations of the three elements <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>:
        <me>
          123 ~~ 132 ~~ 213 ~~ 231 ~~ 312 ~~ 321.
        </me>
        but most of these have one or more elements fixed: <m>123</m> has all three elements fixed since all three elements are in their original positions, <m>132</m> has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In fact, the only derangements of three elements are

        If we go up to 4 elements, there are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations. How many of these are derangements? If you list out all 24 permutations and eliminate those which are not derangements, you will be left with just 9 derangements. Let's see how we can get that number using PIE.

              We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the total number of derangements as follows:
              <me>
                d_4 = 4! - \left[{4 \choose 1}3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3} 1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right].
              </me>
              Explain why this is correct.  In particular, for the permutation 1234 (where everything is fixed), where in the expression above is it counted?
            </p>
                </statement>
              </task>
              <solution>
                <p>
            We count all permutations, and subtract those which are not derangements. There are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations of 4 elements. Now for a permutation to <em>not</em> be a derangement, at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed. There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> choices for which single element we fix. Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements. There are <m>3!</m> permutations on 3 elements. But now we have counted too many non-derangements, so we must subtract those permutations which fix two elements. There are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for which two elements we fix, and then for each pair, <m>2!</m> permutations of the remaining elements. But this subtracts too many, so add back in permutations which fix 3 elements, all <m>{4 \choose 3}1!</m> of them. Finally subtract the <m>{4 \choose 4}0!</m> permutations (recall <m>0! = 1</m>) which fix all four elements. All together we get that the number of derangements of 4 elements is:
            <me>
              4! - \left[{4 \choose 1}3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3} 1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right] = 24 - 15 = 9.

              </solution>
            </activity>
            <p>
        Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements of any number of elements. However, the more elements we have, the longer the formula gets. Here is another example:

              </statement>
              <solution>
                <p>
            We are counting derangements on 5 elements. There are <m>5!</m> ways for the gentlemen to grab hats in any order<mdash/>but many of these permutations will result in someone getting their own hat. So we subtract all the ways in which one or more of the men get their own hat. In other words, we subtract the non-derangements. Doing so requires PIE. Thus the answer is:
            <me>
              5! - \left[{5 \choose 1}4! - {5 \choose 2}3! + {5 \choose 3}2! - {5 \choose 4}1! + {5 \choose 5}0!\right].

            <title>Counting surjective functions</title>
            <p> 
        There are six surjective functions  <m>f:[3]\to [2]</m>, which happens to be <m>2^3 - 2</m>.  This makes sense because there are eight functions all together, but two are not surjective (do you see why?).
      </p>
            <p>
        Consider functions <m>f:[3]\to [3]</m>.  Since each element of the domain has three potential images, there are <m>3^3</m> such functions.  If we only count the injective (one-to-one) functions, we will find <m>3! = 6</m>.  Since the size of the domain and codomain are equal, this is also the number of surjective functions (since every injective function is surjective in this case).  
      </p>
            <p>
        However, when the size of the codomain is larger than the size of the domain, there will be no injections and plenty of surjections.  To see how to count surjections in general, let's explore the case above where we know the answer already.

          Suppose you have two number cubes with non-standard labels.  The first has 1's on four sides and 2's on the remaining two sides, while the second cube has two 1's and four 2's. You will roll the pair of dice and compute the sum of the numbers rolled.

          A standard problem to use when introducing probability is to ask for the probability of rolling a particular sum on two regular number cubes (dice numbered 1 through 6).  Students might not immediately see that some sums are more likely to occur than others.  You can illustrate this by creating a table.

          <title>Visualizing Counting with Pictures</title>
          <p>Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as
      <me>
          \ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
          +\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
      </me>
      Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus <m>\ap</m> stands for taking an apple, <m>\ap\pe</m> for taking an apple and a pear, and <m>\ap\ap</m> for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the <q>exclusive or,</q> that is, <m>\ap+\ba</m> would stand for <q>I take an apple or a banana but not both.</q> To say <q>I take both an apple and a banana,</q> we would write <m>\ap\ba</m>. We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to
      <me>
          \ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
          \ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
      </me>
      </p>
          <p>In this notation <m>\ap^3</m> stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while <m>\ap^2\ba</m> stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set <m>\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}</m>.<fn>This approach was inspired by George P√≥lya's paper <q>Picture Writing,</q> in the December, 1956 issue of the <pubtitle>American Mathematical Monthly</pubtitle>, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than P√≥lya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.</fn>
      </p>
          <p>Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as

We interpret <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret <xref ref="threefruitsagain">Formula</xref> as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.

          <title>Picture functions</title>
          <p>As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent<fn>We are really adapting language introduced by George P√≥lya.</fn> some. By a <term>picture</term> of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture <m>P(s)</m> to each member <m>s</m> of a set <m>S</m> will be called a <term>picture function</term> . The <term>picture enumerator</term><idx><h>picture enumerator</h></idx> for a picture function <m>P</m> defined on a set <m>S</m> will be
      <me>
          E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
      </me>
      </p>
          <p>We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of <m>S</m> according to their pictures. Thus <xref ref="uptothreefruits">Formula</xref> is the picture enumerator on the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.

          <p>  
          Generating functions for infinite sequences are examples of power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.<fn>In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology <q>generating function</q> may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.</fn> Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.
      </p>
          <p>
        Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of <m>y+1</m> for <m>x</m> in the power series <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i</m>, because in order to interpret <m>\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i</m> as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the <m>(y+1)^i</m> terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of <m>y^0</m>, and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any<nbsp/><m>y^i</m>. (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute <m>y+y^2</m> for <m>x</m>. Can you see why?)

          <title>Power series</title>
          <p>For now, most of our uses of power series will involve just simple algebra. Since we use power series in a different way in combinatorics than we do in calculus, we should review a bit of the algebra of power series.

      <title>Product principle for generating functions</title>
      <p>
        Each time that we converted a picture function to a generating function by substituting <m>x</m> or some power of <m>x</m> for each picture, the coefficient of <m>x</m> had a meaning that was significant to us. For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted <m>x</m> for each of our pictures, the exponent <m>i</m> in the power <m>x^i</m> is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to <m>x^i</m>. After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of <m>x</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> is the number of fruit selections that use <m>i</m> pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute <m>x^c</m> for a picture, where <m>c</m> is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the <m>i</m> in an <m>x^i</m> term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to <m>x^i</m>, and the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with <m>i</m> calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.

        The binomial theorem tells us how to expand the binomial <m>(1+x)^n</m>:
        <me>
          (1+x)^n = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}x + \binom{n}{2}x^2 + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}x^n

        This works for any positive integer <m>n</m>.

          <p>
        We will now consider the <em>extended</em> binomial theorem, which tells us what to do if <m>n</m> is a negative integer.  In particular, we will see how to expand <m>(1+x)^{-n} = \frac{1}{(1+x)^n}</m> (here taking <m>n</m> positive again).

        Although we could use calculus-like tricks to manipulate series directly (and we will demonstrate this in a bit), let's first try to develop the formula combinatorially using generating functions.  After all, <m>(1+x)^n</m> is the generating function for the number <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>[n]</m> (you should be able to say why for two good reasons now).

                  <m>(x+y)^n=\sum_{i=0}^\infty\binom{n}{i}x^i</m>. The proof consists of writing <m>(x+y)=y(\frac{x}{y}+1)</m> and applying the <xref ref="negnchoosek"/> when <m>n</m> is negative. When <m>n</m> is positive, we recall that <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is zero when <m>k>n</m>, so replacing the upper limit of <m>n</m> in the standard version of the binomial theorem by <m>\infty</m> doesn't change the value of the sum. 
                  When <m>n=-3</m> we get <m>(x+y)^n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \binom{-3}{i}x^iy^{-3-i} = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^i \binom{3+i-1}{i}x^iy^{-3-i}</m>. 
                  Expanding our binomial coefficients gives <m>(x+y)^{-3} = \binom{2}{0}x^0y^{-3} -\binom{3}{1}x^1y^{-4} + \binom{4}{2}x^2y^{-5}-\cdots.</m> The surprise is that we get an infinite series in positive and negative powers of variables. In order to limit ourselves to infinite series with nonnegative exponents, we do not pursue this idea further.

          <title>Generating Functions and Recurrence Relations</title>
          <p>Recall that a recurrence relation for a sequence <m>a_n</m> expresses <m>a_n</m> in terms of values <m>a_i</m> for <m>i\lt n</m>. For example, the equation <m>a_i=3a_{i-1} +2^i</m> is a first order linear constant coefficient recurrence.
    </p>
          <p>
      Algebraic manipulations with generating functions can sometimes reveal the
      solutions to a recurrence relation.  
    </p>
          <example xml:id="eg_genfun-recursion">
            <statement>
              <p>
          Find a generating functions for the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}</m> with initial conditions <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 13</m> (this is the same recurrence relation we solved using the characteristic root technique in <xref ref="eg_char-roots"/>).
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          In general, we have some generating function <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots</m>.  In this case, we know that <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 13</m>; we can find <m>a_3 = 51</m> and, by working backwards, <m>a_0 = 1</m>.  Having these values makes writing the following out a little clearer.
        </p>
              <p>
          In addition to <m>f(x)</m> we will also consider <m>3x\cdot f(x)</m> and <m>4x^2 f(x)</m>.
          <md><mrow>f(x) = \amp 1 + 3x + 13x^2 + 51 x^3 + \cdots </mrow><mrow> 3x f(x) = \amp 3x + 9x^2 + 39x^3 + 153 x^4 +  </mrow><mrow> 4x^2 f(x) = \amp 4x^2 + 12x^3 + 52x^4 + 204 x^5 +  </mrow></md>
          Now subtract: <m>f(x) - 3xf(x) - 4x^2f(x) = 1</m>.  That's it.  Everything else on the right and side cancels.  Why?  Well, if you consider the <m>x^n</m> term, it will be <m>a_n x^n - 3a_{n-1}x^n - 4a_{n-2}x^n</m>.  The recurrence relation tells us that the coefficient will be zero!
        </p>
              <p>
          Simplifying this a bit more, we find <m>[1- 3x - 4x^2]f(x) = 1</m>, or that the generating function for the sequence is
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2}
          </me>.
        </p>
              <p>
          Now the question becomes, why does this help?  We would like to find a closed formula for <m>a_n</m>.  Right now, we just know that <m>a_n</m> is the coefficient of <m>x^n</m> in the power series for <m>\frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2}</m>.  We will come back to this in the next subsection.

      In the next section we will see how to use the generating functions for these recursions to find closed formulas for the sequence, including a closed formula for the Fibonacci numbers.  While we are here though, consider the following example of another reason why having a generating function for the Fibonacci numbers is useful.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Use generating functions to prove the identity <m>F_{n+1} = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \cdots </m> (note this is a finite sum).
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          Start with the generating function for the sequence <m>1, 1, 2, 3, 5</m>, which we saw in <xref ref="originalFibonacci"/> is 
          <me>\frac{1}{1-x-x^2} = 1 + x + 2x^2 + \cdots + F_{n+1}x^n+ \cdots</me>.
          Of course we also have 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots
          </me>
          and this is almost the same thing.  In fact, if we replace <m>x</m> with <m>x+x^2</m> we get the Fibonacci generating function:
          <md><mrow>\frac{1}{1-(x+x^2)} = \amp 1 + (x+x^2) + (x+x^2)^2 + \cdots </mrow><mrow> = \amp 1 + x(1+x) + x^2(1+x)^2 + x^3(1+x)^3 + \cdots</mrow></md>.
          Now use the binomial theorem on each of the <m>(1+x)^n</m> terms and distribute:
          <md><mrow>1 + x + x^2 + (x^2 +\amp 2x^3 + x^4)</mrow><mrow> + (\amp x^3 + 3x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6)</mrow><mrow> \amp + (x^4 + 4x^5 + 6x^6 + 4x^7 + x^8) + \cdots </mrow></md>.
          Look at the coefficient of <m>x^4</m>, for example.  We have <m>F_5 = 1 + 3 + 1 = \binom{4}{0} + \binom{3}{1} + \binom{2}{2}</m>.  It should be clear that this works in general: the coefficient of <m>x^n</m> will be <m>F_{n+1}</m> on the one hand, and <m>\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2}+ \cdots</m> on the other.
        </p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
      We also point out that there are other techniques for getting the generating function for a sequence other than the <q>differencing</q> we have used above.  We illustrate this with an extreme example.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Find the generating function for the sequence <m>(a_n)</m> where <m>a_n = \binom{2n}{n}</m>.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          We have seen that the power series <m>1 + x + x^2 + \cdots </m> can be written as <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>.  Here we wish to find a nice expression for <me>\binom{1}{0} + \binom{2}{1}x + \binom{4}{2}x^2 + \binom{6}{3}x^3+ \cdots</me>.
        </p>
              <p>
          First we note a sort of recurrence: <m>(n+1)a_{n+1} = (4n+2)a_n</m>.  To verify this use the factorial formula for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>:
          <me>
            (n+1)a_{n+1} = (n+1)\binom{2n+2}{n+1} = (n+1)\frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)}{(n+1)!(n+1)!}(2n)! = (4n+2)\binom{2n}{n} 
          </me>.
        </p>
              <p>
          Now, <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> has derivative 
          <me>
            f'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n
          </me> 
          and further
          <me>
            xf'(x) = a_1x + 2a_2x^2 + 3a_3x^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty na_nx^n
          </me>.
          
          Using the recurrence above, we have
          <me>
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n = 4\sum_{n=0}^\infty na_nx^n + 2\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n
          </me>.
          This means 
          <me>
            f'(x) = 4xf'(x) + 2f(x)
          </me>
          or equivalently <me>\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \frac{2}{1-4x}</me>.
          
          Now integrate!  We get <me>\ln f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\ln(1-4x) + c</me>.
          Since <m>a_0 =1</m>, it must be <m>c = 0</m>.  Finally then, by exponentiating, we arrive at
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-4x}}
          </me>.
          
        </p>

      The generating functions you found in the previous section all can be expressed in terms of the reciprocal of a quadratic polynomial. However without a power series representation, the generating function doesn't tell us what the sequence is. It turns out that whenever you can factor a polynomial into linear factors (and over the complex numbers such a factorization always exists) you can use that factorization to express the reciprocal in terms of power series.

          <p>Writing down the equations in <xref ref="partialfractions1"/> and solving them is called the <term>method of partial fractions</term>.<idx><h>partial fractions</h><h>method of</h></idx> This method will let you find power series expansions for generating functions of the type you found in <xref ref="secondorderintroduction">Problems</xref> to <xref ref="secondordernonhomo"/>. However you have to be able to factor the quadratic polynomials that are in the denominators of your generating functions.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Let's return to our familiar recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}</m> with initial terms <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 13</m>.
        </p>
              <p>
         In <xref ref="eg_char-roots"/> we used the characteristic root technique to find the closed formula <me>a_n = \frac{4}{5} 4^n + \frac{1}{5} (-1)^n </me>.  In <xref ref="eg_genfun-recursion"/> we found that the generating function for the sequence was <me>
           f(x) = \frac{1}{1-3x - 4x^2}
         </me>.
         
         We can use partial fractions to reconcile these two results.         
        </p>
              <p>
          Note that the denominator factors as <m>(1+x)(1-4x)</m>.  We write
          <me>
            \frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2} = \frac{c}{1+x}+\frac{d}{1-4x}
          </me>
          and solve for <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>.  This is done by finding a common denominator and equating the numerators to get
          <me>
            1 = c(1-4x) + d(1+x)
          </me>
          Note that if <m>x = -1</m> this gives use <m>1 = 5c</m> so <m>c = \frac{1}{5}</m>.  Similarly, if <m>x = \frac{1}{4}</m> we find <m>1 = \frac{5}{4}d</m> so <m>d = \frac{4}{5}</m>.  (These constants should look familiar.)
        </p>
              <p>
          So what?  The generating function for <m>a_n</m> can now be expressed as the sum of two generating functions: <m>\frac{1/5}{1+x}</m> and <m>\frac{4/5}{1-4x}</m>.  What's more, these generating functions have nice power series:
          <me>
            \frac{1/5}{1+x} = \frac{1}{5}\left( 1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots +(-1)^nx^n+\cdots\right)
          </me>;
          <me>
            \frac{4/5}{(1-4x)} = \frac{4}{5} \left(1+4x + 16x^2 + \cdots + 4^nx^n+ \cdots \right)
          </me>.
          Both of these were found by substituting a value (either <m>-x</m> or <m>4x</m>) into the power series for <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>.
        </p>
              <p>
          Since <m>a_n</m> is the coefficient of <m>x^n</m>, we get 
          <me>
            a_n = \frac{1}{5}(-1)^n + \frac{4}{5}4^n
          </me>

      The point of the previous exercise is to notice how generating functions illustrate where the extra factor of <m>n</m> comes from in the general form <m>a_n = \alpha r^n + \beta n r^n</m> you get for a closed formula when using the characteristic root technique on a recurrence that gives you a repeated root <m>r</m>.  For any <m>r</m>, we have the power series
      <me>
        \frac{1}{(1-rx)^2} = 1 + 2(rx) + 3(rx)^2 + \cdots + (n+1)(rx)^n + \cdots
      </me>,
      using the extended binomial theorem and substituting <m>rx</m> for <m>x</m>.  The coefficient of <m>x^n</m> is then <m>(n+1)r^n = r^n + nr^n</m>.

          Recall the recurrence for the Catalan numbers is

        <title>Partitions of Sets</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
      Partitions are one of the core ideas in discrete mathematics.  Recall that a <term>partition</term> of a set <m>S</m> is a collection of mutually disjoint subsets of <m>S</m> whose union is all of <m>S</m>.  In other words, every element of <m>S</m> belongs to exactly one of the subsets of the partition.  We call the subsets that make up the partition <term>blocks</term> or <term>parts</term> of the partition.
    </p>
          <p>
      The integers can be naturally partitioned into evens and odds.  In fact, this is just a specific case of partitioning the integers by their reminder when divided by a fixed constant; another example is that every integer has remainder 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 3.
    </p>
          <p>
      Finite sets also have natural partitions: the set of all 4-bit strings can be partitioned according to weight: <me>\B^4_0 \cup \B^4_1 \cup \B^4_2 \cup \B^4_3 \cup \B^4_4 = \B^4</me>.
      Using the sum principle on these disjoint sets leads directly to the identity
      <m>\binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{4} = 2^4</m>
      (and of course the 4 can be replaced with any <m>n</m> here).
    </p>

      In fact, many of the identities we established in <xref ref="sec_basic-proofs"/> using a combinatorial proof work precisely because we can count a set of outcomes all at once and also by counting the size of each block in a particular partition.  For example, in <xref ref="act_derangement-binom"/> we proved that
      <me>\binom{n}{0} d_{0} + \binom{n}{1} d_{1} + \binom{n}{2} d_{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} d_{n} = n!</me>
      by partitioning the <m>n!</m> permutations of <m>[n]</m> into blocks according to how many are fixed in position while the rest are deranged.  
    </p>
          <p>
      Even the formula for binomial coefficients, <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}</m>, comes from partitioning the <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>[n]</m> into blocks according to which subset of <m>[n]</m> is selected (and then <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is precisely the number of blocks).
    </p>
          <p>
      In this section we will abstract this fundamental idea of partitions by one level.  Instead of using particular partitions to answer counting questions, we will ask counting questions about partitions themselves.  As we will see, this helps us solve yet more counting questions. 
    </p>
          <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_basic-quotient"/> we considered some ways to distribute items to recipients.  Most basic counting formulas can be thought of as counting the number of ways to distribute either distinct or identical items to distinct recipients.  For example, distributing <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> distinct recipients can be done in <m>n^k</m> ways, if recipients can receive any number of items, or <m>P(n,k)</m> ways if recipients can receive at most one item.  If the items are identical, the corresponding number of ways to distribute them are <m>\mchoose{n}{k}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      What if the recipients are not distinct?  Say we wish to distribute <m>k</m> books (either distinct or identical) to <m>n</m> identical boxes.  This is a perfectly natural extension, but we will see the answer is not.  First, let's get a feel for what this might look like for some small values of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>.

      Both of the previous two activities can be solved by counting partitions.  The difference comes down to whether we partition a set of distinct objects or identical objects.  It is not immediately clear how to model partitioning identical objects, and we will put this off until <xref ref="sec_adv-linearparts"/>.  Partitioning <em>distinct</em> objects simply means finding a partition of a set, the topic of the current section.

          <title>Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind</title>
          <p>
      We would like to count the number of ways to partition a set.
    </p>
          <definition xml:id="def-stirling">
            <statement>
              <p>
          Denote by <m>S(k,n)</m> the number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into exactly <m>n</m> subsets.  We call <m>S(k,n)</m> a <term>Stirling number (of the second kind)</term>.
        </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
      Note that we write <m>S(k,n)</m> instead of <m>S(n,k)</m> here because we try to use <m>k</m> for the number of elements being distributed and <m>n</m> for the number of recipients.  When other books use <m>S(n,k)</m>, they mean the number of partitions of <m>[n]</m> into exactly <m>k</m> blocks.  This is the same definition as we give, but with our renamed variables the formulas we get might look different.
    </p>
          <p>
      For example, consider how to partition <m>[3]</m> into exactly two sets:
      <me>
        \{1,2\}, \{3\} \qquad \qquad \{1,3\},\{2\} \qquad \qquad \{2,3\},\{1\}
      </me>
      and that is all, so <m>S(3,2) = 3</m>.  We do not care about the order the elements appear in each block, nor the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus we see the Stirling numbers count the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> identical recipients so that each recipient gets at least one item.

              <p>
          First, here are the partitions of <m>[4]</m> into 2 blocks (group A) or 3 blocks (group B), side by side:

          (Notice the <m>\binom{4}{2}</m> ways of listing the middle column in group B.)

              <p>
          Now, to list the <m>S(5,3)</m> partitions of <m>[5]</m> into <m>3</m> parts, we need to add 5 somewhere.  We can either
          <ol label="a."><li>
              <p>
                Let 5 be a singleton block, along with any of the partitions from group A; or

            </li><li>
              <p>
                Let 5 join any of the blocks in any of the partitions of group B.  
              </p>
            </li></ol>
          The second option can be accomplished in <m>3\cdot 6</m> ways.  Thus <m>S(5,3) = 7 + 3\cdot 6</m>.

        We have often thought of counting problems as asking about how many functions there are from a <m>k</m>-elements set to an <m>n</m>-element set.  The answer to this question is <m>n^k</m> for all functions and <m>P(n,k)</m> for injective functions.  What about surjective functions?  There is a reason we haven't asked this question yet, but now we can at least get an expression for the number of surjections in terms of Stirling numbers.

      Here is a brief summary of what we have already discovered.
    </p>
          <p>
      Directly from the definition, we see that <m>S(k,1) = 1</m> and <m>S(k,k) = 1</m>.  From these we can compute the remaining Stirling numbers using the recursion
      <me>
        S(k,n) = nS(k-1,n) + S(k-1, n-1).
      </me>
      This recursion is justified by dividing the partitions of <m>[k]</m> into those which contain <m>k</m> as a singleton set (there are <m>S(k-1, n-1)</m> of these) and those that don't (there are <m>n</m> choices for where <m>k</m> could be for each of the <m>S(k-1, n)</m> partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks).

          <p>
      From this, we generated Stirling's second triangle.

      While we might not have a nice closed formula for all Stirling numbers in terms of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>, we can give closed formulas for those Stirling numbers close to the edges of the triangle.

However, just multiplying these two double counts since we do not care about the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus there are <m>\frac{1}{2}\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2} = 15</m> partition of <m>[5]</m> of this type.

The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> as follows. If factor <m>i</m> is labelled <m>j</m> we let <m>f(i) =j</m>. Further each function <m>f</m> from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> gives us that maps <m>i_j</m> elements of <m>[k]</m> to <m>j</m> will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the multinomial coefficient <m>\binom{k}{i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n}</m>.

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            The following argument is due to Polya.
            Suppose you wished to paint n houses and you have <m>k</m> different colors available.
            The first house can be painted in <m>k</m> different ways, the second in <m>k</m> different ways, etc.
            So there are <m>k^{n}</m> ways.
            How many ways actually use all <m>k</m> colors?
            Let <m>\alpha_{i}</m> be the property that no house is painted with the <m>i</m>th color, and let <m>N(\alpha_{i})</m> denote the number of ways of painting the <m>n</m> houses without using the <m>i</m>th color.
            Analogously for <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j})</m>, <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k})</m>, etc.
            Since <m>N(\alpha_{i}) = (k - 1)^{n}</m>, <m>N(a_{i},\alpha_{j}) = ( k - 2)^{n}</m> and so on, the number of ways of painting <m>n</m> houses using all <m>k</m> colors is, using PIE,
            <m>k^{n} -\binom{k}{1} \left(k - 1 \right)^{n} + \binom{k}{2} \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} - \binom{k}{3}      \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k}\binom{k}{k} 0^{n}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternately, we could first partition the <m>n</m> houses into <m>k</m> (non-empty) sets, and then paint each set. This can be    accomplished in <m>k!S(n,k)</m> ways. Now equate these two expressions.

            Again, based on the proof by Polya.
            We can paint <m>n</m> houses, with <m>x</m> colors available, in <m>x^{n}</m> ways. Using exactly one color, there are <m>S\left( n,1 \right)x</m> ways. Using exactly two colors there are <m>S\left( n,2 \right)x(x - 1)</m> ways. Continue in this manner.

          </exploration>
          <p>
      As an example of the previous two theorems, consider how to write <m>x^3</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Using <xref ref="thm-stirling-polynomial"/>, we can write
      <me>
        x^3 = S(3,1)x + S(3,2)x(x-1) + S(3,3)x(x-1)(x-2) = x + 3x(x-1) + x(x-1)(x-2)
      </me>.
      Recognizing that the factors that involve <m>x</m> look like a factorial, we can convert them into binomial coefficients, which is what <xref ref="thm-stirling-polynomial2"/> says:
      <me>
        x^3 = \binom{x}{1} + 3\binom{x}{2}2! + \binom{x}{3}3! = \binom{x}{1} + 6\binom{x}{2} + 6 \binom{x}{3}.
      </me>
    </p>
          <p>
      Less we think this is nothing more than an interesting factoid, we can use it to establish the following.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Prove that <m>1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2</m>.  In other words, the square of any triangular number is the sum of cubes!
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          We recognize that each cube on the left-hand side can be expressed as <m>\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}</m>.  Thus
          <md><mrow>1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \left(\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}\right)</mrow><mrow> = \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{1} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{2} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{3}</mrow></md>.
          Now each of the three sums of binomial coefficients can be simplified using the Hockey Stick Theorem, to get
          <md><mrow> =  \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6 \binom{n+1}{3} + 6 \binom{n+1}{4} </mrow><mrow> = \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\left(\binom{n+1}{3}+\binom{n+1}{4}\right) </mrow><mrow> = \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\binom{n+2}{4} </mrow></md>
          where the last step uses the Pascal triangle recurrence.
        </p>
              <p>
          Finally, write these last two binomial coefficients using the factorial formula and simplify:
          <me>
            \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n(n-1)}{4} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
          </me>.

          <title>Bell Numbers</title>
          <p>
      The Bell number, <m>B_{k}</m>, denotes the number of ways that a set of <m>k</m> objects can be partitioned into nonempty subsets.
      We have already seen how to partition a set of <m>k</m> objects into exactly <m>n</m> subsets: <m>S(k,n)</m>.  So then <m>B_k = \sum_{n=1}^kS(k,n)</m>.  We take <m>B_0 = 1</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      The sequence of Bell numbers starts
      <me>
        1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, \ldots
      </me>
      Notice that the first four numbers look like Catalan numbers.  In fact, one of the many things the Catalan numbers count are <em>non-crossing</em> set partitions.<fn>A set partition is said to be <term>non-crossing</term> as long as whenever <m>a,b</m> belong to one block and <m>c,d</m> belong to another, we have that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both either larger or smaller than both of <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>.</fn>  So if <m>C_n</m> counts only some of the set partitions, then it must be that <m>C_n \le B_n</m> for all <m>n</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      The Bell numbers can be generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a 2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues.

      To summarize, construction of the triangle follows two basic rules:
      <ol><li>
          <p>
            The last number of each row is the first number of the next row.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            All other numbers are found by adding the number to the left of the
            missing number to the number directly above this same number.
          </p>
        </li></ol>

      When the triangle is extended, as above, the Bell Numbers are found down
      the first column as well as along the outside diagonal.

          If the sum of a row is added to the Bell number at the end of that row, the next Bell number is obtained. For example, the sum of the fourth row plus the Bell number at the end of the row: <m>15 + 20 + 27 + 37 + 52 + 52</m> is 203, the next Bell number.  Why does this happen?

          Another pattern you might notice: the numbers of the second diagonal <m>1, 3, 10, 37, 151, 674, \ldots</m> are the sums of the horizontal rows.  Prove this!

      Rotating the triangle slightly creates a <em>difference</em> triangle analogous to Pascal's Triangle. The entries that are formed recursively by adding in Pascal's Triangle are now differences of the two numbers above them in the Bell triangle.

      The Bell numbers are related to the Stirling numbers and can be defined
      as the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
      That is, <m>B_{k} = S(k,1) + S(k,2) + \cdots + S(k,k)</m>, where <m>S(k,n)</m> represents the number of ways of grouping <m>k</m> elements into <m>n</m> subsets.
      So <m>B_{3} = S(3,1) + S(3,2) + S(3,3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5</m>.
      Since the Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of elements, they are used in prime-number theory to enumerate the number of ways to factor a number with distinct prime factors.
      For example, 42 has three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7.
      Since <m>B_{3} = 5</m> , we know there are five ways of factoring 42.
      These are <m>2 \times 3 \times 7</m>, <m>2 \times 21</m>, <m>3 \times 14</m>, <m>6 \times 7</m>, and <m>42</m>.
      So the number <m>210</m>, which has 4 distinct factors, 2, 3, 5, and 7, can be factored in <m>B_{4} = 15</m> ways.
    </p>
          <p>
      The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For
      example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled
      twin beds is <m>B_{2} = 2</m> ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in
      separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of
      three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is <m>B_{3} = 5</m> ways:
      each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on
      one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on
      another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example
      serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three
      unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed
      together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any
      situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty
      subsets.
    </p>
          <p>
      One interesting application of Bell numbers is in counting the number of
      rhyme schemes possible for a stanza in poetry. There are <m>B_{2} = 2</m> possibilities for a two-line stanza: the lines can either rhyme or not
      rhyme. The possible rhyme schemes of a three-line stanza can be
      described as aaa, aab, aba, abb, and abc: thus there are 5 or <m>B_{3}</m> possible rhyme schemes. The Japanese used diagrams depicting possible
      rhyme schemes of a five-line stanza <m>B_{5} = 52</m> as early as 1000
      A.D. in the <em>Tale of the Genji</em> by Lady Shikibu Murasaki.

        In <xref ref="compositionagian"/>, we counted the <em>compositions</em> of an integer <m>n</m>, by counting the number of solutions to the equation <m>x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n</m> where each <m>x_i</m> is a positive integer.  Put another way, we asked how many <em>lists</em> of <m>k</m> positive integers have sum <m>n</m>.  The order in which we listed the sum mattered.  What if it didn't?

        A multiset of positive integers that add to <m>n</m> is called a <term>partition</term><idx><h>partition of an integer</h></idx> of <m>n</m>. Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of <m>k</m> is denoted by the <term>partition number</term> <m>p(k)</m>; in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that <m>p(3) = 3</m>. It is traditional to use Greek letters like <m>\lambda</m> to stand for partitions; we might write <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, <m>\gamma= 2,1</m> and <m>\tau = 3</m> to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write <m>\lambda = 1^3</m> as a shorthand for <m>\lambda = 1,1,1</m>, and we write <m>\lambda \dashv 3</m> as a shorthand for <q><m>\lambda</m> is a partition of three.</q>

          <example>
        There are 5 partitions of 4 (so <m>p(4) = 5</m>).  They are <m>4=1+1+1+1</m>, <m>4=2+1+1</m>, <m>4=2+2</m>, <m>4=3+1</m>, and <m>4=4</m>.

            The number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts is <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. We can divide the compositions into blocks, where two compositions are in the same block if and only if one is a rearrangement of the other. Then the blocks correspond bijectively to partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts. However we cannot compute the number of blocks by dividing by the number of compositions per block since the number of compositions per block ranges from <m>1</m> to <m>n!</m>.  But then if we divide the number of compositions by <m>n!</m> we will get a number less than the number of blocks because <m>n!</m> times the number of blocks would be, by the sum principle, greater than the number of partitions.

              They are equal, because if we take two different partitions

              still different; also if we take two different partitions of <m>k</m> that

              one), they are still different.

        When we write a partition as <m>\lambda = \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>, it is customary to write the list of <m>\lambda_i</m>s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector <m>(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)</m> for a partition, we write either <m>\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}</m> or <m>\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}</m>. Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write <m>\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}</m>, we will assume that <m>\lambda_i&gt;\lambda_i+1</m>.

        It is remarkable that there is no known formula for <m>p_n(k)</m>, nor is there one for <m>p(k)</m>. We have computed a few values of <m>p_n(k)</m> by listing partitions.  If we continue to do so, we could build a triangle of partition numbers as follows.

          So for example, <m>p_3(7) = 4</m>: <m>(5,1,1)</m>, <m>(4,2,1)</m>, <m>(3,3,1)</m>, and <m>(3,2,2)</m>.  It sure would be nice to find the next row without having to list out all the partitions.  Perhaps we could use some sort of recursion!
        </p>
          <p>
        With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set <m>S</m> of numbers if we remove the largest element of <m>S</m>. Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we will be able to <q>see</q> how to get smaller partitions from larger.

        The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list <m>(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)</m>, we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has <m>\lambda_1</m> equally spaced dots in the first row, <m>\lambda_2</m> equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge.

At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.

        The natural way to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of <m>n</m> is to remove some of the squares from the Young diagram.  We lots of choices here. 
        <ol><li>
            <p>
              We could remove the entire top row.
            </p>

              We could remove the entire left-most column.

              We could remove a single box somewhere. But from where?
            </p>
          </li></ol>
        Removing the top row corresponds to removing the largest part of the partition.  Removing the left-most column corresponds to subtracting 1 from each part.  Removing a single box will reduce one part by 1.  Some of these might be more useful than others.

        <me>
          p_n(k) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(k-n) = p_1(k-n) + p_2(k-n) + \cdots + p_n(k-n)

        For example, <me>p_4(9) = p_1(5) + p_2(5) + p_3(5)+ p_4(5) = 1+2+2+1 = 6</me>

            Since the recurrence is a sum of smaller partition numbers, we are claiming that we can break the partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts into different groups, and each group will correspond to a different collection of smaller partitions.  How can you describe these groups geometrically?

            Suppose we wanted to compute <m>p_5(13)</m>.  Since we have the 8th row of the partition number triangle, we should be able to do this with the long recursion.  What if we wanted to use the short recursion?
          </p>
              <p>
            Use the short recursion to compute <m>p_5(13)</m>.  If you get a partition number that you don't yet know, use the short recursion to compute that as well (you know, the way you use recursions).

        As you see above, the short recursion is nothing more than grouping all but the first term in the sum into a single partition number, using the long recursion again.  This should make sense based on the geometry of the Young digrams.

                <p>Take the top row and left

            once.) Now take the remaining squares in the next row and column and make
            a new row of the Young diagram of the second partition with them.
            Continue this process with succeeding rows and columns, not using any
            squares you have already used. Because the first partition is self
            conjugate, the diagram has the same number of rows as columns and row
            <m>i</m> and column
            <m>i</m> have the same length. Because row <m>i</m> and column <m>i</m> share one
            square, and we only use that square once when we create a new row, each row
            we create has odd length. Thus we get a partition with the same number of
            squares, so it is a partition of <m>k</m> and each part is odd. The parts are
            distinct because when we take off the squares of a row and column, we
            reduce the number of squares in each row and column that remains. Given
            a partition of <m>k</m> into distinct odd parts, we use the fact that each
            row has a unique middle element, and each is shorter than the one
            above (by at least two squares) to reverse the process. Thus we have a
            bijection.

            The number of partitions of <m>k</m> into even parts equals the
            number of partitions of parts of even multiplicity, because if we take
            the Young diagram of a partition of <m>k</m> into even parts and conjugate
            it, the resulting diagram has columns of even length. Thus the
            difference in heights of two successive columns is an even number,
            but this difference is the multiplicity of one of the parts of the
            conjugate. Further the height of the last column of a partition is
            the multiplicity of the first part. Since the multiplicity of any part
            of a partition is either the difference in height of two successive
            columns of the Young diagram or the height of the last column, then
            each part of the conjugate has even multiplicity. This bijection can
            be reversed, because if all the differences in height of the columns are
            even and the height of the last column is even, then when we
            conjugate this partition, the last row will be an even length, and
            all differences in length of the rows will be even, so all the parts

            The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts with largest part <m>m</m>. Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is <m>m</m> or more units wide (horizontally) and <m>n</m> or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an <m>m'</m> unit wide and <m>n'</m> unit deep rectangle with <m>m'\ge m</m> and <m>n' \ge n</m>, as in <xref ref="complementpartition"/>.

The lengths of the rows are nonnegative, and are nondecreasing as we move down. Therefore, after we rotate through 180 degrees, these same rows will be listed in the opposite order, lined up along the left sides, and will have nonincreasing length. Thus they will be the Young diagram of a partition.

        To deal with an odd number of repetitions of the complementation

                <p>
            Let us call the process of enclosing <m>\lambda</m> in the smallest rectangle possible and then forming the complement in that rectangle <term>encomplementation</term> (This is short for <em>en</em>\/closure and <em>complementation</em> and is not a standard term<mdash/>there is no standard term for this operation.) and call the result of it the <term>encomplement</term><idx><h>encomplement of a partition</h></idx> of <m>\lambda</m>.  The result of two encomplementations on the Young diagram of a partition is to remove all rows of maximum length and all columns of maximum length from the Young diagram. Thus the description of the result of an even number <m>2j</m> of encomplementations is straightforward; we remove all the rows of the <m>j</m> largest distinct lengths and all columns of the <m>j</m> largest distinct lengths. So if an even number of encomplementations brings us to a partition with one block of size one, we should be able to describe the original partition fairly easily. To deal with the result of an odd number of encomplementations, we ask what happens if we encomplement just once.  If the complement of <m>\lambda</m> in the smallest rectangle in which if fits has one square, then <m>\lambda =\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_1-1</m>. Thus we are asking for the partitions which, after an even number of encomplementations, give us either the partition with one block or a partition of the form <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m>. First we ask what kind of partition results in the second one after two encomplementations. If we get <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> from two encomplementations, the partition we started with had the form
            <me>
              \lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+\lambda_{2})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+
              \lambda_2-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}.
            </me>
          </p>
                <p>
            If we get <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> from four encomplementations, then we started with a partition of the form
            <me>
              \lambda_{-1}^{n_{-1}}(\lambda_0+\lambda_{3})^{n_0}(\lambda_1+
              \lambda_2 +
              \lambda_{3})^{n_1}(\lambda_1+\lambda_2 +\lambda_3-1)(\lambda_2+
              \lambda_{3})^{n_3}
              \lambda_3^{n_3}.
            </me>
          </p>
                <p>
            From this pattern we see that a partition that results in <m>\lambda_1^{n_1}(\lambda_1-1)</m> after <m>2j</m> encomplementations has the form
            <men xml:id="form1">
              \lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
              \lambda_0^{n_0}
              {\lambda'_1}^{n_1}
              (\lambda'_1-1)\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
              \lambda_{j+1}^{n_{j+1}},
            </men>
            where <m>\lambda_i&gt;\lambda_{i+1}</m> and <m>\lambda_0&gt;\lambda'_1&gt;\lambda_2+1</m>.
          </p>
                <p>
            On the other hand, a partition <m>\lambda</m> that results in <m>1</m> after two encomplementations has the form <m>\lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}</m>, and so a partition that results in 1 after <m>j</m> encomplementations is of the form
            <men xml:id="form2">
              \lambda_{1-j}^{n_{1-j}}\lambda_{2-j}^{n_{2-j}}\cdots
              \lambda_0^{n_0}(\lambda_1+1)\lambda_1^{n_1}\lambda_2^{n_2}\cdots
              \lambda_j^{n_j},
            </men>
            where <m>\lambda_i&gt;\lambda_{i+1}</m> and <m>\lambda_0&gt;\lambda_1+1</m>. Thus a partition results in a single part of size 1 after some number of encomplementations if and only if it has the form of <xref ref="form1">Equation</xref> or <xref ref="form2">Equation</xref>.

Perhaps you could write down the partitions of 4 into two parts and the partitions of 5 into two distinct parts and look for a natural bijection between them. So the hope is that you will discover a bijection from the set of partitions of 7 into three parts and the partitions of 10 into three distinct parts.

              <p>We start by giving a function from the set of partitions of <m>k</m> to the set of partitions of <m>k</m> with (only) odd parts. Clearly such a function cannot be one to one. Then we show that when restricted to the partitions with distinct parts it is one-to-one and onto by constructing an inverse. Given a partition <m>\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}</m>, write <m>\lambda_i=\gamma_i2^{k_i}</m>, where <m>\gamma_i</m> is odd. (Thus <m>2^{k_i}</m> is the highest power of 2 that is a factor of <m>\lambda_i</m>, so it is 1 if <m>\lambda_i</m> is odd.). It is possible that <m>\gamma_i=\gamma_j</m>, for example if <m>\lambda_i=36</m> and <m>\lambda_j=18</m>, then <m>\gamma_i=\gamma_j=9</m>. We construct a new partition <m>\pi</m> whose parts are the numbers <m>\gamma_j</m> as follows: Given an odd number <m>p</m>, let the multiplicity <m>m(p)</m> of <m>p</m> in <m>\pi</m> be <m>\sum_{j: \gamma_j=m} 2^{k_j}</m>. Thus <m>\sum_{p: m(p)\not=0}m(p)p = k</m>. Therefore, <m>\pi</m> is a partition of <m>k</m> whose parts are all odd.
        </p>
              <p>Now consider a partition <m>\pi</m> of <m>k</m> whose parts are all odd. Let <m>\pi=\pi_1^{r_1}\pi_2^{r_2}\cdots \pi_t^{r_t}</m>, with <m>\pi_i&gt;\pi_{i+1}</m>. (In terms of the multiplicity function <m>m</m>, <m>m(\pi_i) =r_i</m>, and <m>\sum_{i=1}^t r_i\pi_i = k</m>.) We are going to write the binary expansion of each <m>r_i</m> as <m>r_i = \sum_{j= 0}^{\lfloor \log_2 r_i\rfloor} 2^{ja_{ij}}</m>, where <m>a_{ij}</m> is 1 if <m>2^j</m> appears in the binary expansion of <m>r_i</m>, and 0 otherwise. All of the numbers <m>\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}</m> are distinct, because a power of two times one odd number cannot equal a power of two times another odd number. The numbers <m>\pi_i2^{ja_{ij}}</m> add to <m>k</m>, so they are the parts of a partition <m>\pi'</m> of <m>k</m> into distinct parts. When we apply the function constructed in the first part of the solution to <m>\pi'</m>, we get <m>\pi</m>, so the correspondence between <m>\pi</m> and <m>\pi'</m> is a bijection.

          Suppose we have a partition of <m>k</m> into distinct parts. If the smallest part, say <m>m</m>, is smaller than the number of parts, we may add one to each of the <m>m</m> largest parts and delete the smallest part, and we have changed the parity of the number of parts, but we still have distinct parts. On the other hand, suppose the smallest part, again say <m>m</m>, is larger than or equal to the number of parts. Then we can subtract 1 from each part larger than <m>m</m>, and add a part equal to the number of parts larger than <m>m</m>. This changes the parity of the number of parts, but if the second smallest part is <m>m+1</m>, the resulting partition does not have distinct parts. Thus this method does not work. Further, if it did always work, the case <m>k \ne \frac{3j^2+j}{2}</m> would be covered also. However you can modify this method by comparing <m>m</m> not to the total number of parts, but to the number of rows at the top of the Young diagram that differ by exactly one from the row above. Even in this situation, there are certain slight additional assumptions you need to make, so this hint leaves you a lot of work to do. (It is reasonable to expect problems because of that exceptional case.) However, it should lead you in a useful direction.

              <p>This solution is taken largely from the book <pubtitle>Introduction to Combinatorics</pubtitle> by Ioan Tomescu (published in London by Collet's in 1975). Tomescu calls a collection of rows in a Young diagram a <q>trapezoid</q> if each row contains one less cell than the row above and the number of cells in the rows above and below the trapezoid differ by two or more from the number of cells in rows of the trapezoid. Thus in (8,6,5,4,2,1) we have 3 trapezoids, the first row, the next three rows, and the last two. Since we are dealing with partitions with distinct parts, we don't have to worry about how two equal rows affect the definition of a trapezoid. We will describe a way to transform a partition with an even number of distinct parts into a partition with an odd number of distinct parts and vice versa.
        </p>
              <p>
          First we describe a transformation on Young diagrams. Here is the first part of the description. Suppose the smallest part <m>m</m> of <m>\lambda</m> is less than or equal to the number <m>j</m> of rows in the top trapezoid. Suppose further that if we have only one trapezoid, then <m>j&gt;m</m>. Then we construct a partition with one less part by adding 1 to each of the <m>m</m> largest parts and discarding the part <m>m</m>. We still have a diagram for a partition of the same integer, but now the parity of the number of parts has changed, and we <em>may</em> have increased the number of trapezoids by 1. The smallest part will now be larger than the number (now <m>m</m>) of rows in the top trapezoid. (Notice that the construction would not work if we had only one trapezoid and <m>j=m</m> because we would first remove one row of the trapezoid and thus have no row to which to attach one of our squares.)
        </p>
              <p>Here is the second part of the description of the transformation. Suppose now that <m>m</m> is larger than the number <m>j</m> of rows of the top trapezoid in the Young diagram. Suppose also that the Young diagram has at least two trapezoids or it has one trapezoid and <m>j\ge m-2</m>. Take one square from each of the <m>j</m> rows of the top trapezoid (which is the whole diagram if there is only one trapezoid) and also add a row of <m>j</m> squares at the bottom of the diagram. (Since <m>m&gt;j</m>, this gives us a Young diagram of a partition of the same integer into distinct parts.) The parity of the number of rows has changed, and now the number of rows of the top trapezoid is at least as large as the smallest part of the partition. (Note, two previously distinct trapezoids may have joined together to form one on top.)  (Notice that if we have one trapezoid and <m>j= m+1</m>, then the construction yields a partition with two equal parts, which is why we made the special assumption above.) Now let <m>T</m> be the transformation described by the two constructions above. Its domain is all Young diagrams except those with one trapezoid and <m>m\le j\le m+1</m>. <m>T^2</m> is the identity, and so <m>T</m> is a bijection.  When restricted to partitions with an odd number of parts, <m>T</m> gives partitions with an even number of parts, so on its domain it gives a bijection between partitions with an even number of parts and partitions with an odd number of parts.
        </p>
              <p>If <m>m=j</m> and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has <m>\frac{3j^2-j}{2}</m> squares, and if <m>m=j+1</m> and the diagram has just one trapezoid, then the diagram has <m>\frac{3j^2+j}{2}</m> squares. Thus if <m>k\ne \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m>, the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into distinct even parts equals the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into distinct odd parts.
        </p>
              <p>If <m>k= \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m> and <m>j</m> is even, then there is one diagram of a partition of <m>k</m> that is not in the domain of the bijection and has an even number of rows, so in this case there will be one more partition with an even number of parts than with an odd number. If <m>k= \frac{3j^2\pm j}{2}</m> and <m>j</m> is odd, there is one diagram with an odd number of rows not in the domain and so in this case there is one more partition with an odd number of parts than with an even number. This completes the exceptional cases of the problem.

      How does the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts compare to the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts (not necessarily distinct)?
      What do compositions have to do with partitions?
        </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>
          The number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> parts is <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>. Divide the compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts into blocks with two compositions in the same block if one is a rearrangement of the other. Because the parts are distinct, each block has <m>n!</m> members. Further, there is a bijection between the blocks of this partition and the partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts. Since the number of compositions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>, the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <m>n</m> distinct parts is less than <m>\frac{1}{n!}  \binom{k-1}{n-1}</m>.

          <title>Using Generating Functions</title>

    I this final section we will see that generating functions are especially well suited for the study of integer partitions.  We will start with a classic example.

Do the same thing assuming we have an unlimited supply of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.

                  x^{25i}=\frac{1-x^6}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1-x^{30}}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1-x^{60}}{

              <p>Although we could write this as a polynomial times a product of four power series, doing so would not significantly increase our understanding, though it would let us make some painful computations of the number of ways to make a certain number of cents.

With unlimited supplies the generating function becomes
          <me>
              \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^5}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{10}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x^{25}}.

          </p>
              <p>Again, we could write this as a product of power series, and that would allow us to painfully compute the number of ways to create a certain number of cents. If we actually wanted to know the number of ways to make up 200 cents, say, it would be more sensible to ask a computer algebra package to extract the coefficient of <m>x^{200}</m> in the product of the four quotients.

              Conjugation is a bijection between partitions with largest part at most <m>m</m> and partitions with at most <m>m</m> parts. Thus the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> into parts of size at most <m>m</m>) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m> will be the coefficient of <m>x^i</m> (the number of partitions of <m>i</m> with at most <m>m</m> parts) in the generating function for the number of partitions of integers into parts of size at most <m>m</m>. Thus the two generating functions are the same.

              In <xref ref="genfunpartitions"/>, we multiplied together infinitely many power series. Here are two notations for infinite products that look rather similar:
            <me>
                \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad

            </me>
            </p>

            <p>However, one makes sense and one doesn't. Figure out which one makes sense and explain why it makes sense and the other one doesn't. If we want a product of the form
            <me>
                \prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x),
            </me>
            where each <m>p_i(x)</m> is a nonzero polynomial in <m>x</m> to make sense, describe a relatively simple assumption about the polynomials <m>p_i(x)</m> that will make the product make sense. If we assumed the terms <m>p_i(x)</m> were nonzero power series, is there a relatively simple assumption we could make about them in order to make the product make sense? (Describe such a condition or explain why you think there couldn't be one.)
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
If infinitely many of the polynomials had a nonzero coefficient for <m>q</m>, would the product make any sense?

        </hint>

        <solution>
            <p>
                <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +x^i +x^{2i} +\cdots + x^{i^2}</m> makes sense because when we look for ways of choosing one summand from each factor so that the summands multiply together to give us <m>x^k</m>, we will find only finitely many ways of making those choices, so the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> can be taken to be the number of such choices. On the other hand, in the expression <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 + x + x^2 +\cdots+ x^i</m>, there are infinitely many ways to choose <m>x</m> from one term and <m>1</m> from all the rest of the terms so that the product of these summands is <m>x</m>. Thus we can't even specify what the coefficient of <m>x</m> is in the product. On the basis of this analysis, we see that for <m>\prod_{i=1}^\infty 1 +p_i(x)</m> to make sense, we need to assume that for each possible positive integer <m>n</m>, there are only a finite number of polynomials <m>p_i</m> whose lowest degree term has degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>. In that way, for each positive integer, there will be only finitely many ways to chose a summand from each factor so that the product of the summands is a multiple of <m>x^k</m>. The same assumption works when the <m>p_i</m> are power series, for the same reason.

          By considering a Young diagram and its compliment, we saw that there is a one to one correspondence between partitions that have exactly <m>m</m> parts and partitions that have <m>m</m> as their largest part.  
        </p>
              <p>
          The generating function for the number of partitions of integers having <em>largest</em> part <m>m</m> is 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots (1-x^m)}
          </me>.
          Thus this is also the number of partitions of integers having <em>at most</em> <m>m</m> parts.
          Now subtract those having at most <m>m-1</m> parts:
          <me>
            \frac{1}{(1-x)\cdots (1-x^m)} - \frac{1}{(1-x)\cdots (1-x^{m-1})} = \frac{x^m}{(1-x)\cdots(1-x^m)}
          </me>.
          
          
        </p>
              <p>
          Alternatively, instead of doing the algebra on the last step, we can use Young diagrams again.  There is a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> into exactly <m>m</m> parts and partitions of <m>k-m</m> into at most <m>m</m> parts.  The bijection is: remove the first column!  So look at the infinite series for <m>\frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)\cdots (1-x^m)}</m>.  The coefficient of <m>x^{k-m}</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k-m</m> into at most <m>m</m> parts.  So if we multiply each term by <m>x^m</m>, then the coefficient of <m>x^{k-m+m} = x^{k}</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k-m</m> into at most <m>m</m> parts.  But this is the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into <em>exactly</em> <m>m</m> parts, as required.

          First,

            \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)} = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^5 + 7x^6 + \cdots

          Now multiply the series by <m>x^3</m>.  The term <m>3x^6</m> shows that there are <m>3</m> partitions of <m>n=6</m> into exactly 3 parts.

This shows that only one of the partitions of <m>n=6</m> into 3 parts has its parts distinct.  Further, there are <m>4</m> partitions of <m>n = 10</m> into exactly 3 distinct parts:

            Prove that
            <me>
              \frac{1}{1-x} = (1 + x + x^2 +\cdots + x^9)(1 + x^{10} + \cdots + x^{90})(1 + x^{100} + \cdots + x^{900})\cdots.

            What does this tell us about numbers?

              <solution>
                <p>
            If we write the right hand side using quotients, we get
            <me>
              \frac{1-x^10}{1-x}\cdot \frac{1-x^{100}}{1-x^{10}}\cdot \frac{1-x^{1000}}{1-x^{100}}\cdot\cdots.
            </me>
            We see that all terms will cancel excpt for
            <me>
              \frac{1}{1-x}.
            </me>
          </p>
                <p>
            Now written as a polynomial, <m>\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots</m>.  So the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> will be 1 for all <m>k</m>.  The right hand side though gives the genereting function for the number of ways to write a number as the sum of up to 9 ones, up to 9 tens, up to 9 one hundreds, and so on.  In other words, this generating function gives the number of ways to write a number in base 10.  And since the coefficients are all 1, we see that this number of ways is 1; that is, there is a unique base 10 representation of every natural number.

              <solution>
                <p>
            We repeat the previous part, but this time show that
            <me>
                \frac{1}{1-x} = (1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^4)(1+x^8)(1+x^{16})\cdots.
            </me>
            Writing the right hand side as quotients, you see that again every term cancels except for the left hand side.

            How can you interpret this result?

              <solution>
                <p>
            Replicating the method from above, we see that this expression simplifies to <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>.  We can interpret the expression as the generating function for the number of ways to write a number in base 3.  So this result shows that the base 3 representation is unique.

            <p>In <xref ref="largestpartatmostm"/> and <xref ref="atmostmparts"/> you gave the generating functions for, respectively, the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into parts the largest of which is at most <m>m</m> and for the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into at most <m>m</m> parts. In this problem we will give the generating function for the number of partitions of <m>k</m> into at most <m>n</m> parts, the largest of which is at most <m>m</m>.

Geometrically, it is the generating function for partitions whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle, as in <xref ref="rectanglecomplement"/>. This generating function has significant analogs to the binomial coefficient <m>\binom{m+n}{n}</m>, and so it is denoted by <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m>.

                    We want to calculate the number of partitions whose Young diagrams fit into a two by two square. These partitions have at most two parts and the parts have size at most two. Thus they are partitions of 1, 2, 3, or 4. However not all partitions of 3 or 4 have diagrams that fit into a two by two square. Try writing down the relevant diagrams.

                <p>
                    A partition with up to two parts of size up to two can have no parts, one part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 1, one part of size 2 which makes it a partition of 2, two parts of size 1, which makes it a partition of 2, a part of size 2 and a part of size 1, which makes it a partition of 3, or two parts of size 2, which makes it a partition of 4. Thus <m>\qchoose{4}{2}=1+x+2x^2+x^3+x^4</m>.

                        The largest part of a partition counted by <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is either <m>m</m> or is less than or equal to <m>m-1</m>.  In the second case, the partition fits into a rectangle that is at most <m>m-1</m> units wide and at most <m>n</m> units deep.  What is the generating function for partitions of this type?  In the first case, what kind of rectangle does the partition we get by removing the largest part sit in?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle?  What is the generating function for partitions that sit in this kind of rectangle after we remove a largest part of size <m>m</m>?  What recurrence relation does this give you?
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>The generating function for partitions that arise in the second case is <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}=\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}</m>. In the first case, after we delete the largest part, the Young diagram sits in a rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n-1</m>. The generating function for partitions that arise in the first case <em>after</em> we have deleted a part of size <m>m</m> is <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus the generating function for partitions that arise in the first case (<em>before</em> we delete the part of size <m>m</m>) is <m>x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}</m>. Thus by the sum principle the generating function for all partitions that fit into a rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n</m> is given by
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}= x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}+\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}.
                    </me>
                    </p>

                    <p>If you don't use the symmetry <m>\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}=\qchoose{m+n-1}{n}</m>, you get
                    <me>
                        \qchoose{m+n}{n}= x^m\qchoose{m+n-1}{n-1}+\qchoose{m+n-1}{m-1}.

                    <p>
                        While this doesn't <em>quite</em> look like the Pascal recurrence, it is still a correct answer.

                    <p>We either have exactly <m>k</m> parts or fewer than <m>k</m> parts. In the first case, removing one from each part gives us a partition whose Young diagram fits into a <m>m-1</m> by <m>n</m> box, while in the second case doing nothing gives us a partition that fits into a <m>m</m> by <m>n-1</m> box. In the first case the partition we get partitions <m>k-n</m>, and in the second case it still partitions <m>k</m>. Thus we get

                    Since the generating function is a finite sum (we are talking about partitions whose Young diagram into a finite rectangle), the limit is obtained by setting <m>q=1</m>, and this sums the number of partitions of each possible number <m>k</m> that have at most <m>n</m> parts all of size at most <m>m</m>. We want a bijection between such partitions and the <m>n</m> element subsets of an <m>m+n</m> element set. Recall that there is a bijection between subsets of an <m>n</m> element set and lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>m,n</m> in a coordinate plane. If we draw our rectangle of width <m>m</m> and depth <m>n</m> with its lower left corner at <m>(0,0)</m>, then each Young diagram gives us such a lattice path and each such lattice path gives us a Young diagram.

                <p><m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is the generating function for the number of partitions whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. That is,
                <me>
                    \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kx^k,
                </me>
                where <m>a_k</m> is the number of partitions of <m>k</m> whose Young diagram fits into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. In particular <m>a_k=0</m> if <m>k>mn</m>, because the Young diagram of a partition of a number larger than <m>mn</m> certainly cannot fit into an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle. Thus
                <me>
                    \qchoose{m+n}{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{mn} a_kx^k.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, <m>a_k=a_{mn-k}</m>, because the complement in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle of a partition of <m>k</m> is a partition of <m>mn-k</m>, and complementation in an <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> rectangle is a bijection between partitions of <m>k</m> that fit into the rectangle and partitions of <m>mn-k</m> that fit into the rectangle. Thus <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>mn</m> in which the coefficient of <m>q_k</m> equals the coefficient of <m>x^{mn-k}</m>. For this reason we can compute the limit as <m>q</m> approaches <m>-1</m> simply by substituting <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> in the polynomial; the only trouble being that the formula we know for <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is quotient of polynomials that has zero in both the numerator and denominator when we substitute in <m>q=-1</m>. Nonetheless, when we substitute <m>-1</m> for <m>q</m> we get the alternating sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>.  Thus if <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite sign, they will cancel out. If <m>mn</m> is even, <m>i</m> is even exactly when <m>mn-i</m> is even, and so <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have the same sign. However when <m>mn</m> is odd, <m>a_i</m> and <m>a_{mn-i}</m> have opposite signs in the sum <m>\sum_{i=0}^{mn} (-1)^ia_i</m>, and so the sum is zero.  Thus the polynomial <m>\qchoose{m+n}{n}</m> is zero at <m>q=-1</m> whenever <m>mn</m> is odd.
                </p>

                <p>Our experience with binomial coefficients might lead us to hope that the alternating sum of the coefficients <m>a_k</m> will always be zero. However, we computed that <m>\qchoose{4}{2}=1+x+2x^2+x^3+x^4</m>, so
                <me>
                    \lim_{q\rightarrow -1}\qchoose{4}{2}=1-1+2-1+1=1.
                </me>
                </p>

                <p>We could compute some more values of the limit by going back to the definition in this way, but it seems unlikely that we could get enough data to make a good conjecture. However we have the recurrence, and setting <m>q=-1</m> in the recurrence gives us <xref ref="q-binomial-tab" />.  From the table, it is clear that we get binomial coefficients interspersed with 0s in the even numbered rows of our table and repeated binomial coefficients in the odd numbered rows of our table. In particular when <m>m+n</m> and <m>n</m> are both even, <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=\binom{(m+n)/2}{n/2}</m>, and if <m>m+n</m> is even and <m>n</m> is odd, <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=0</m>. In our table, at least, if <m>m+n</m> is odd, it appears that we get <m>\negchoose{m+n}{n}=\binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}</m>. In fact, using the recurrence just as we used it to construct the table, we can prove by induction that
                <me>
                    \negchoose{m+n}{n}=\left\{
                    \begin{array}{ll}0\amp \mbox{if \(mn\) is odd} \\
                    \binom{\lfloor(m+n)/2\rfloor}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\amp \mbox{otherwise.}
                    \end{array} \right.

        <p>
      To start our journey into discrete mathematics, let's consider a few puzzles.
    </p>
        <investigation>
          <statement>
            <p>
            In the time of Euler, in the town of K√∂nigsberg in Prussia, there was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this question. Are you?

      All the puzzles above have a feature in common: they involve the ways in which individual (discrete) objects can be related to each other.  This is what graph theory studies, and we will see that each of the puzzles can be solved with the tools of the subject.  Before we start developing those tools, take a moment to see why graphs are applicable to these problems.

      In the bridges of K√∂nigsberg puzzle, all that really matters is which land masses are connected by bridges, and how many bridges connect them.  The length of the bridges and size of the land masses is unimportant.  So we can represent this puzzle with a graph like this:

      Now we must decide whether it is possible to travel around that graph in a way that each edge is crossed exactly once.
    </p>
        <p>
      When it comes to friendship, if we assume that it is always reciprocated, we can represent the people as vertices and connect two vertices with an edge if the people they represent are friends.  We can ask whether it is possible to have such a graph in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges or whether it is possible to <q>color</q> the vertices with just four colors so that no pair of same colored vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge).
    </p>
        <p>
      If we have thirteen piles of cards, we represent each pile as a vertex and each value as a vertex, and connect a pile vertex to a value vertex precisely when that value is in the pile.  We could then ask whether we could select a collection of thirteen edges that do not share any single vertex.
    </p>
        <p>
      These puzzles give you just a small glimpse into the myriad of applications graph theory can address.  For us, we will use our study of graph theory to see how reasoning in discrete mathematics works and as an excuse to remind ourselves of the basic mathematical objects and proof techniques required to study the subject in general.

	  Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines) this is fairly ambiguous.  Do the lines need to be straight?  Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?  Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?  Can one line connect three dots?</p>
        <p>
		  The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous <em>definitions</em>.  Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important.  The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed.  Is there a graph with no edges?  We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.
		</p>
        <p>
		  We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying.  It needs to be useful: we <em>could</em> define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges.
		</p>
        <activity>
          <statement>
            <p>
					Write a definition for a <em>graph</em>.  Make sure that your definition can be helpful in making sense of <xref ref="activity-graphdiff"/>.
				</p>
          </statement>
        </activity>
        <p>
		  Writing definitions is hard.  You should compare what you came up with to the following:
		</p>
        <definition>
          <p>	A <term>graph</term> is an ordered pair <m>G = (V, E)</m> consisting of a nonempty set <m>V</m> (called the <term>vertices</term>) and a set <m>E</m> (called the <term>edges</term>) of two-element subsets of <m>V</m>.</p>
        </definition>
        <p>
		 	Strange.  Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines.  From the definition, a graph could be <me>(\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\}).</me>
		 Here we have a graph with four vertices  (the letters <m>a, b, c, d</m>) and four edges (the pairs <m>\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})</m>).
	 	</p>
        <p>
			Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process.  That is why we often draw a representation of these sets.  We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges.  Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:
		</p>
        <sidebyside width="25%">
          <image>
            <latex-image>
				\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]

			  \end{tikzpicture}
			</latex-image>
          </image>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
		However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example either of these:
	</p>

        <p>
		We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be <q>the same.</q>  Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?  Are the edge sets equal?  We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets. </p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
					Are the graphs below equal? <me>G_1 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}\}); \qquad G_2 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,c\}, \{c, b\}\})</me> equal?
				</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
				  No.  Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start.  Also, both graphs have two edges.  In the first graph, we have edges <m>\{a,b\}</m> and <m>\{b,c\}</m>, while in the second graph we have edges	<m>\{a,c\}</m> and 	<m>\{c,b\}</m>.  Now we do have <m>\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}</m>, so that is not the problem.  The issue is that <m>\{a,b\} \ne \{a,c\}</m>.  Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are not equal (as graphs).
				</p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
		 Even if two graphs are not <em>equal</em>, they might be <em>basically</em> the same. The graphs in the previous example could be drawn like this:

		 Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called <term>isomorphic</term>. We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick example:
	</p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
				Consider the graphs:
			</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
				<m>G_1 = \{V_1, E_1\}</m> where <m>V_1 = \{a, b, c\}</m> and <m>E_1 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}\}</m>;
			</p>
              <p>
				<m>G_2 = \{V_2, E_2\}</m> where <m>V_2 = \{u,v,w\}</m> and <m>E_2 = \{\{u,v\}, \{u,w\}, \{v,w\}\}</m>.
			</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
				Are these graphs the same?
			</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
				The two graphs are NOT equal. It is enough to notice that <m>V_1 \ne V_2</m> since <m>a \in V_1</m> but <m>a \notin V_2</m>. However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair of vertices. We can draw them as follows:

				Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so while they are not equal, they will be <em>isomorphic</em>. The reason is we can rename the vertices of one graph and get the second graph as the result.
			</p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
		Intuitively, graphs are <term>isomorphic</term> <idx><h>isomorphic</h></idx> if they are basically the same, or better yet, if they are the same except for the names of the vertices. To make the concept of renaming vertices precise, we give the following definitions:
	</p>
        <definition>
          <p>
			<idx><h>isomorphic</h></idx> An
			<term>isomorphism</term><idx><h>isomorphism</h></idx> between two graphs <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m> is a bijection <m>f:V_1 \to V_2</m> between the vertices of the graphs such that <m>\{a,b\}</m> is an edge in <m>G_1</m> if and only if <m>\{f(a), f(b)\}</m> is an edge in <m>G_2</m>.
		</p>
          <p>
			Two graphs are
			<term>isomorphic</term> if there is an isomorphism between them. In this case we write <m>G_1 \isom G_2</m>.
		</p>
        </definition>
        <p>
		An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely if they were connected by edges with their old names.
	</p>
        <example>
          <statement>
            <p>
				Decide whether the graphs <m>G_1 = \{V_1, E_1\}</m> and <m>G_2 = \{V_2, E_2\}</m> are equal or isomorphic.
			</p>
            <p>
				<m>V_1 = \{a,b,c,d\}</m>, <m>E_1 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}\}</m>
			</p>
            <p>
				<m>V_2 = \{a,b,c,d\}</m>, <m>E_2 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{c,d\}\}</m>
			</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
				The graphs are NOT equal, since <m>\{a,d\} \in E_1</m> but <m>\{a,d\} \notin E_2</m>. However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they <em>might</em> be isomorphic (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).
			</p>
            <p>
				We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say <m>f(a) = b</m>, <m>f(b) = c</m>, <m>f(c) = d</m> and <m>f(d) = a</m>. This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it <em>respects the edge relation</em>. In <m>G_1</m>, vertices <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are connected by an edge. In <m>G_2</m>, <m>f(a) = b</m> and <m>f(b) = c</m> are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge <m>\{a,c\}</m> in <m>G_1</m> corresponds to <m>\{f(a), f(c)\} = \{b,d\}</m>, but here we have a problem. There is no edge between <m>b</m> and <m>d</m> in <m>G_2</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is NOT an isomorphism.
			</p>
            <p>
				Not all hope is lost, however. Just because <m>f</m> is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.

				Alternatively, notice that in <m>G_1</m>, the vertex <m>a</m> is adjacent to every other vertex. In <m>G_2</m>, there is also a vertex with this property: <m>c</m>. So build the bijection <m>g:V_1 \to V_2</m> by defining <m>g(a) = c</m> to start with. Next, where should we send <m>b</m>? In <m>G_1</m>, the vertex <m>b</m> is only adjacent to vertex <m>a</m>. There is exactly one vertex like this in <m>G_2</m>, namely <m>d</m>. So let <m>g(b) = d</m>. As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice: let <m>g(c) = b</m> and <m>g(d) = a</m> (switching these would be fine as well).
			</p>
            <p>
				We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in <m>G_1</m> are
				<me>
					\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}
				</me>
			</p>
            <p>
				Under the proposed isomorphism these become

					\{g(a), g(b)\}, \{g(a), g(c)\}, \{g(a), g(d)\}, \{g(c), g(d)\}
				</me>

			<me>
				\{c,d\}, \{c,b\}, \{c,a\}, \{b,a\}

				which are precisely the edges in <m>G_2</m>. Thus <m>g</m> is an isomorphism, so <m>G_1 \cong G_2</m>

		Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like <m>K_n</m> or the <em>Peterson graph</em>) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels.

A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an <term>isomorphism class</term><idx><h>isomorphism class</h></idx>.<fn>This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular triangle.

					Recall that in order for <m>f</m> to define an isomorphism between <m>G1</m> and <m>G2</m>, it must preserve relationships between vertices. To put this into context, this means that since <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are joined via an edge in <m>G1</m> that their corresponding vertices in <m>G2</m> must also be joined by an edge. This must be true for all of the vertices and edges. When examining the function, we can see that the vertex <m>g</m> goes to <m>v_7</m>, that is <m>f(g)=v_7</m>. BUT, <m>g</m> has exactly 2 edges (so <m>g</m> is degree 2) and <m>v_7</m> is degree 3. This means that <m>f</m> cannot possibly be an isomorphism. Similarly, we can see that <m>f</m> does not take <m>c</m> to the correct vertex either <m>c</m> is degree 2 and <m>v_1</m> has degree 3.

						No, it could not possibly be isomorphic. If you count up the degrees of each vertex in this picture, you can see that the highest degree is 4 (the center vertex). In order to be isomorphic to either <m>G_1</m> or <m>G_2</m> we would definitely need a vertex of degree 5, which we don't have.

				Is it possible for two <em>different</em> (non-isomorphic) graphs to have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges? What if the degrees of the vertices in the two graphs are the same (so both graphs have vertices with degrees 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, for example)? Draw two such graphs or explain why not.
			</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
				Yes. For example, both graphs below contain 6 vertices, 7 edges, and have degrees (2,2,2,2,3,3).

		 We would like to say that the smaller graph is a <em>subgraph</em> of the larger.
	</p>
        <p>
	  We should give a careful definition of this.  In fact, there are two reasonable notions for what a subgroup should mean.
	</p>
        <definition>
          <p>
		  We say that <m>G' = (V', E')</m> is a <term>subgraph</term><idx><h>subgraph</h></idx> of <m>G = (V, E)</m>, and write <m>G' \subseteq G</m>, provided <m>V' \subseteq V</m> and <m>E' \subseteq E</m>.
		</p>
          <p>
		  We say that <m>G' = (V', E')</m> is an <term>induced subgraph</term><idx><h>subgraph</h><h>induced</h></idx><idx><h>induced subgraph</h></idx> of <m>G = (V, E)</m> provided <m>V' \subseteq V</m> and every edge in <m>E</m> whose vertices are still in <m>V'</m> is also an edge in <m>E'</m>.
		</p>
        </definition>
        <p> Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph, but not conversely.  Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges from the larger graph.  For the subgraph to be an induced subgraph, we can still delete vertices, but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.

		Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called <term>simple</term>, although we will just call them <em>graphs</em>. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.
	</p>
        <p>
		That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single edge loops. For example, the <q>graph</q> we drew for the Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call these objects <term>multigraphs</term><idx><h>multigraph</h></idx>. This is a good name: a <em>multiset</em> is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.
	</p>
        <p>
		The graphs above are also <term>connected</term><idx><h>connected</h></idx>: you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>:

	 Most of the time, it makes sense to treat non-connected graphs as separate graphs (think of the above graph as two squares), so unless otherwise stated, we will assume all our graphs are connected.
	</p>
        <p>
		Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called <term>complete</term><idx><h>complete graph</h></idx>. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: <m>K_n</m><notation><usage>K_n</usage><description>the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices</description></notation> is the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices.
	</p>
        <p>
		Each vertex in <m>K_n</m> is adjacent to <m>n-1</m> other vertices. We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the <term>degree</term> of that vertex. So every vertex in <m>K_n</m> has degree <m>n-1</m>. How many edges does <m>K_n</m> have? One might think the answer should be <m>n(n-1)</m>, since we count <m>n-1</m> edges <m>n</m> times (once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice. Thus there are <m>n(n-1)/2</m> edges in <m>K_n</m>.
		<!-- Alternatively, we can say there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> edges, since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <m>n</m> vertices. -->
	</p>
        <!-- TODO: put an activity introducing the handshake lemma here -->
        <p>
		In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be <em>twice</em> the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!
	</p>
        <example>
          <statement>

				At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands. Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?
			</p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
				It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be <m>9\cdot 7 = 63</m>. This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with <m>31.5</m> edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an <em>even</em> number of people at the seminar.
			</p>
          </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
		One final definition: we say a graph is <term>bipartite</term><idx><h>bipartite</h></idx> if the vertices can be divided into two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, with no two vertices in <m>A</m> adjacent and no two vertices in <m>B</m> adjacent. The vertices in <m>A</m> can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in <m>B</m>. If each vertex in <m>A</m> is adjacent to all the vertices in <m>B</m>, then the graph is a <term>complete bipartite graph</term>, and gets a special name: <m>K_{m,n}</m>, where <m>|A| = m</m> and <m>|B| = n</m>. The graph in the houses and utilities puzzle is <m>K_{3,3}</m>.

    How might you use graph theory to solve the puzzle above?  One thing to try would be to create a graph consisting of six vertices, one for each value that appears on the dominoes.  Then connect the vertices if their numbers belong to the same domino.  This seems reasonable, but then how would you represent the line of matched up dominoes the puzzle requests?
  </p>
          <p>
    Say you start with domino <m>(4,6)</m>.  That is an edge in our graph.  Next we need to place a domino with a 6 on it (or a 4, but let's say the 4 will be an endpoint).  This amounts to selecting another edge, one that is incident to the vertex 6.  Say we pick <m>(6,5)</m>.  The edge we must select after that will need to be incident to vertex 5.  And so on.
  </p>
          <p>
    The edges we select in the graph need to be linked up.  It makes sense to think about the selection of edges as traveling through the graph, moving along edges from vertex to vertex.  Let's capture this notion carefully.

        A <term>walk</term> in a graph <m>G = (V,E)</m> is a sequence of vertices <m>v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n</m> such that <m>\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E</m> for all <m>0 \le i \lt n</m>.  That is, consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent in the graph.
      </p>
              <p>
        A <term>trail</term> is a walk that does not repeat any edges.  If the trail starts and ends at the same vertex (i.e., <m>v_1 = v_n</m>) then it is called a <term>circuit</term>
      </p>
              <p>
        A <term>path</term> is a trail that does not repeat any vertices, except perhaps for <m>v_0 = v_n</m>.  In the case that <m>v_0 = v_n</m>, the path is called a <term>cycle</term>.
      </p>
            </statement>
          </definition>
          <p>
    Do these definitions capture what a walk/trail/path should mean in a graph?  All three of these describe ways in which to move around in the graph, perhaps tracing along the edges without lifting up your pencil.
  </p>
          <p>
    Note: some sources give slightly different definitions for these concepts.  For example, sometimes a walk is defined as a alternating sequence of vertices and edges <m>v_1e_1v_2e_2v_3\cdots e_{n-1}v_n</m> with the requirement that <m>v_i</m> is incident to <m>e_i</m>, which is incident to <m>v_{i+1}</m>.  We have not named our edges, so this definition would not make sense.  Another common way to define <em>path</em> is as a subgraph isomorphic to <m>P_n</m> for some <m>n</m>.  This is almost equivalent to our definition, except that we allow our paths to possibly be isomorphic to <m>C_n</m> for some <m>n</m> as well.  Some sources use <em>path</em> where we use <em>walk</em> and use <em>simple path</em> where we use <em>path</em>.
  </p>
          <p>
    Walks and paths are useful for considering all sorts of graph theoretic concepts.  For example, you might want to find the <term>distance</term> between two vertices.  This would be defined as the shortest path starting at one and ending at the other (where the <term>length</term> of a path is the number of edges in it).  If you have a notion of distance, you can define the <em>center</em> and <em>radius</em> of a graph.  Graphs are <em>connected</em> provided between any two vertices, there is a path (or equivalently, a walk).

This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler path (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which do have an Euler path, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit, even if the graph is quite large.
</p>
          <p>
One way to guarantee that a graph does <em>not</em> have an Euler circuit is to include a <q>spike,</q> a vertex of degree 1.

The vertex <m>a</m> has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler path. It starts at the vertex <m>a</m>, then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of degree 3.
</p>
          <p>
You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return, then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a path at, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex. The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.
</p>
          <p>
What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices with odd degree, then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex <em>must</em> have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.
</p>
          <p>
So there is clearly a connection between the parity of vertex degrees and Euler paths and circuits.  Here are two theorems the describe that connection.
</p>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-eulercircuit">
            <p>
  A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even.
  </p>
          </theorem>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-eulerpath">
            <p>
  A connected graph has an Euler path if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.
  </p>
          </theorem>
          <p>
Note that these theorems answer the bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem.  The graph has all four vertices with odd degree, there is no Euler path through the graph.  Thus there is no way for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.

  <title>Interlude: Implications and Proofs</title>
  <p>
    We would like to prove the theorems we conjectured above about Euler paths and circuits.  To help us understand how we could do this, and to make sure our proof is correct, we should take a few moments to recall some basic facts about mathematical statements, their logical form, and how this can help us in writing proofs.  A more detailed discussion of these topics is found in <xref ref="sec_background-logic">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="sec_background-proofs" type="global"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All mathematical statements have a <em>logical form</em> that determines the meaning of the statement and often suggests a method for proving (or disproving) the statement.  At the most basic level, a statement might be <term>atomic</term>, if it is not composed of simpler statements, or otherwise <term>molecular</term>.  A molecular statement is built up of smaller statements by connecting them with a <term>logical connective</term>.
    Such statements might be a <term>conjunction</term> (two statements connected by an <q>and</q>) a <term>disjunction</term> (two statements connected by an <q>or</q>), an <term>implication</term> or <term>conditional</term> (usually in the form <q>if <ellipsis /> then <ellipsis /></q>), or a <term>negation</term> (claiming a statement is <em>not</em> true).
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other logical connectives, used both in mathematical statements and in ordinary language, but every one can be reduced to these four (actually, you can get away with as few as two of them).   For example, it is very common in mathematics to encounter statements of the form <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m>.</q>  This is called a <term>biconditional</term>, but it is nothing more than the conjunction of two implications.  That is, <q><m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m></q> means <q>if <m>P</m> then <m>Q</m>, and if <m>Q</m> then <m>P</m>.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The truth of falsity of a molecular statement is determined entirely by the truth or falsity of its parts, governed by set rules of the connectives.  These rules can be communicated through <term>truth tables</term>.  We use the standard symbols <m>\wedge</m> for <q>and</q>, <m>\vee</m> for <q>or</q>, <m>\imp</m> for implications and <m>\neg</m> for negations.

    Note that the truth table for <m>P \vee Q</m> shows us that we always mean the <em>inclusive or</em>, in that when both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are true, we say that <m>P \vee Q</m> is true.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other truth table worth looking closely at is the one for implications.  This might strike you as strange at first.  If <m>P</m> is false, the implication <m>P \imp Q</m> is true (no matter the truth value of <m>Q</m>).  Also, there is no need for <m>P</m> to <q>cause</q> <m>Q</m> to be true.  For example, the statement <q>If 2 is even, then 2 is prime</q> is true, despite there being no connection between the concepts of <q>even</q> and <q>prime</q>.

    Examining the truth table for <m>P \imp Q</m> further, we notice that it is possible for <m>P \imp Q</m> to be true but <m>Q \imp P</m> to be false. (What would the truth values of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> need to be to make this the case?) We call <m>Q \imp P</m> the <term>converse</term> of <m>P \imp Q</m>.

  <p>
    The claim <m>P</m> if and only if <m>Q</m> is the claim that both an implication and its converse are true.  This is the form that <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="thm-eulerpath" type="global"/> about Euler circuits and paths take.  Looking at the form, we see what it would take to prove them.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prove a biconditional, you simply must prove both implications (the implication and its converse).  How do you prove an implication though?  Well, by looking at the truth table, we see that we must prove that we are always in rows 1, 3, or 4.  The only case we need to exclude is the one where <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.
  </p>

  <p>
    So assume <m>P</m> is true (the other case is automatic).  Under this assumption, we argue that <m>Q</m> is true as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alternatively, we could start by assuming <m>Q</m> is false.  If we can then conclude that <m>P</m> is also false, we have excluded the one suspect case, as we can conclude that <m>P \imp Q</m>.  You could also conclude that <m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m>, which is the <term>contrapositive</term> of <m>P \imp Q</m>.  By comparing truth tables, it is easy to see that any implication is equivalent to its contrapositive, so proving a contrapositive is equivalent to proving its implication.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is one important piece we should mention here: the use of quantifiers.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Is it possible for both a statement and its converse to be false?  What could you say about <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> for such a statement?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>

  <p>
    What about the statement, <q>if <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>p</m> is odd</q>.  This statement is false.  So is its converse.  But the truth tables for <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>Q \imp P</m> do not have a false in the same row.  So what is going on?
  </p>

  <p>
    The key is that we are secretly adding a <term>universal quantifier</term> in front of statements like this.  What we really mean is that <em>for all <m>p</m></em>, if <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>p</m> is odd.  This is false, because <em>there exists</em> (the <term>existential quantifier</term>) some counterexample.  The converse of the statement is, for all <m>p</m>, if <m>p</m> is odd, then <m>p</m> is prime.  This is also false, because there exists a counterexample.  Necessarily, it will be a different counterexample than the one that proved the implication was false.
  </p>

  <p>
    How do you prove a universally quantified statement is true?  You must prove the implication is true <em>for all</em> cases.  To prove that for all <m>n</m>, if <m>n^2</m> is even, then so is <m>n</m>, you must prove this for <m>n = 1</m>, <m>n = 2</m>, <m>n =3</m>, etc.  But to get on with your life, you might as well prove it for all of them at once.  Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.  Now prove the statement for that arbitrary <m>n</m>.  In this case, you might want to assume <m>n</m> is NOT even and prove that <m>n^2</m> is not even, to give a proof by contrapositive.  But since <m>n</m> was arbitrary, you have shown that your poof would work for <em>any</em> value of <m>n</m>.

    Let's try to prove <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="thm-eulerpath" type="global"/>.  Actually, we really only need to prove one of these, and the other one should follow from it.

        Suppose we have already proved <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, that a graph has an Euler circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.  Suppose now we want to prove <xref ref="thm-eulerpath"/>, that a graph has an Euler path if and only if it has at most two odd degree vertices.

                <p>
          Add something to your graph so you can <q>finish</q> the Euler path.  Don't forget to consider the case that the start and end vertex are already adjacent.

                <p>
          Let <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> be the begining and ending vertices of the Euler path.  Now add a vertex <m>v'</m>to the graph and edges <m>\{v_b, v'\}</m> and <m>\{v', v_e\}</m>.  Now the Euler path can be extended through <m>v'</m> and back to <m>v_b</m>, completing an Euler circuit.
        </p>
                <p>
          By <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, we know our new expanded graph will have all vertices of even degree.  But the degrees of <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> have increased by 1, so in the original graph, it must be that <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> (and only these) had odd degree.
        </p>
                <p>
          Note that if <m>v_b</m> and <m>v_e</m> were not adjacent in the original graph, we could have just added an edge connecting them, but adding the new vertex works in that and the case where the vertices were already adjacent.

          Given a graph with at most two odd degree vertices, build a graph that has only even degree vertices.  If you have an Euler circuit of your new graph, what would that Euler circuit become if you looked at your original graph?

          If there are no odd degree vertices, you are done.  If there are two, you could connect them with an edge, except maybe they are already adjacent.  What could you do then?

              <solution>
                <p>
          Let <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m> be the two vertices with odd degree.  We can add a new vertex <m>v'</m> and edges <m>\{v_1, v'\}</m> and <m>\{v_2, v'\}</m>, which increases the degrees of <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m> by 1, making their degrees even.  Also, <m>d(v') = 2</m>, so all vertices now have even degree.
        </p>
                <p>
          If this new graph has an Euler circuit, then we can <q>cut</q> out the path <m>(v_2, v', v_1)</m>.  Specifically, rotate and possibly reverse the circuit so that it starts at <m>v_1</m> and ends with the sequence <m>v_2, v', v_1</m>.  Then simply remove <m>v', v_1</m> from that sequence, to get a Euler path.

          First, suppose a connected graph <m>G</m> has an Euler path.  If this path is an Euler circuit, we are done, since there will be no odd degree vertices.  Otherwise, by part (a), we can form a new graph <m>G'</m> that has an Euler circuit, and by <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>, this <m>G'</m> must have all vertices of even degree.  But part (a) tells us then that <m>G</m> will have exactly two odd degree vertices.
        </p>
                <p>
          Conversely, suppose <m>G</m> has at most two odd degree vertices.  If all vertices are even, then we are done by <xref ref="thm-eulercircuit"/>.  There are no graphs with exactly one odd degree vertex.  So assume that <m>G</m> has exactly two odd degree vertices.  By part (b), we can build a graph <m>G'</m> that has all even degree vertices, which must therefore have an Euler circuit.  But this Euler circuit becomes an Euler path when you look back at <m>G</m>, as required.

        Suppose you had a graph and were given an Euler circuit for that graph.  How might you represent that Euler circuit?  If you listed each edge in order, where each edge was given as a pair of vertices, how many times would each vertex appear in the list?  What have you just shown?
      </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
        Suppose a graph has an Euler circuit, written <m>(v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)</m>.  Since it is a circuit, we have <m>v_0 = v_n</m>.  Consider the edges used in this path.  They are <m>\{v_0, v_1\}</m>, <m>\{v_1, v_2\}</m>, and so on up to <m>\{v_{n-1}, v_n\}</m>.  Every time a vertex appears in the walk, it is part of two edges, except for <m>v_0</m> and <m>v_n</m>.  But these are the same vertex, so taken together, these constitute two edges as well.  Since every edges is used in an Euler circuit, we see that every vertex must have even degree.
      </p>
              <p>
        A simpler way to say all of this: in the Euler circuit, a vertex appearing <m>k</m> times must have degree <m>2k</m>, except for the starting and ending vertex, which will have degree <m>2k</m> if it appears <m>k+1</m> times.
      </p>
            </solution>
          </activity>
          <p>
    The other direction is harder.  If you know every vertex has even degree, you must now show there is an Euler circuit.  One thing you could do is to give a procedure for building one.  But then you must prove that this procedure is correct.  We will come back to this question when we look at mathematical induction.

Suppose you wanted to tour K√∂nigsberg in such a way where you visit each land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a <term>Hamilton path</term> (or <term>Hamiltonian path</term>)<idx><h>Hamilton path</h></idx>.  We could also consider <term>Hamilton cycles</term>, which are Hamilton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.

    The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path.  You would need to visit each of the <q>outside</q> vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get stuck.  Note that this graph does not have an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no Hamilton paths.

          <p>
It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check whether there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete<idx><h>NP-complete</h></idx>.

              Suppose the graph did have a Hamilton cycle, say <m>(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, a_k, b_k, a_1)</m>.  Here we are writing vertices as <m>a_i</m> if they are in the <m>A</m> part of the bipartite graph, and <m>b_i</m> if they are in the <m>B</m> part.  Since there are no edges between vertices in the same part, we know that the cycle must alternate between <m>A</m> vertices and <m>B</m> vertices, before finally returning to the starting <m>A</m> vertex <m>a_1</m>.  In particular, this says that there must be an equal number of vertices in the <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> parts.  But the graph in question does not have this.
            </p>
                <p>
              A simpler way of saying this is that the graph above has 11 vertices, so any Hamliton cycle must include 11 edges.  But since the graph is bipartite, there are no odd length cycles at all.

              We can prove the contrapositive.  Suppose <m>G</m> has a Hamilton path <m>(a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots, v)</m>.  Since <m>G</m> is bipartite, we know that <m>a_i \in A</m> and <m>b_i \in B</m> form a bipartition of the vertices.  The last vertex in the path is either in <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>.  If <m>v \in B</m>, then <m>\card{A} = \card{B}</m>.  If <m>v \in A</m>, then <m>\card{A} = \card{B} + 1</m>.  But in either case, we see that neither part has at least two more vertices than the other.

            <introduction>
              <p>
When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called <term>planar</term>. When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called <term>faces</term>.
</p>
            </introduction>
            <task>
              <statement>
                <p>
      Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices, edges, and faces.
    </p>
              </statement>
            </task>
            <task>
              <statement>
                <p>
      Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices and edges, but a different number of faces.
    </p>
              </statement>
            </task>
          </activity>
          <p>
When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross? If this <em>is</em> possible, we say the graph is <term>planar</term><idx><h>planar</h></idx> (since you can draw it on the <em>plane</em>).
</p>
          <p>
Notice that the definition of planar includes the phrase <q>it is possible to.</q> This means that even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still might be. Perhaps you can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross. For example, this is a planar graph:
</p>
          <sidebyside width="20%">
            <image>
              <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.7, xscale=1.5]
   \draw (-1, 0) \v -- (-.5,2) \v -- (0,0) \v -- (.5, 2) \v -- (1,0) \v -- (-.5,2) (.5,2) -- (-1,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
            </image>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
That is because we can redraw it like this:
</p>
          <sidebyside width="25%">
            <image>
              <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.7, xscale=1.5]
       \draw (-1, 0) \v -- (-.5,2) \v -- (0,0) \v -- (1.5, -1) \v -- (1,0) \v -- (-.5,2) (1.5,-1) -- (-1,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
            </image>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be too. However, the original drawing of the graph was not a <term>planar representation</term> of the graph.
</p>
          <p>
When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. We will call each region a <term>face</term><idx><h>faces</h></idx>. The graph above has 3 faces (yes, we <em>do</em> include the <q>outside</q> region as a face). The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so without the edges crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property of the planar graph.
</p>
          <p>
WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way. For example, consider these two representations of the same graph:
</p>
          <sidebyside widths="20% 25%" margins="auto" valign="bottom">
            <image>
              <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (45:1) \v -- (135:1) \v -- (225:1) \v -- (315:1) \v -- (45:1) -- (225:1) (135:1) -- (315:1);
    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
            </image>
            <image>
              <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (45:1) \v -- (135:1) \v -- (225:1) \v -- (315:1) \v -- (45:1) -- (225:1);
      \draw (135:1) .. controls (70:2) and (20:2) .. (315:1);
    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
            </image>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
      If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say there are 5 faces (including the outside). But drawing the graph with a planar representation shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.
    </p>
          <p>
      Is there a connection between the number of vertices (<m>v</m>), the number of edges (<m>e</m>) and the number of faces (<m>f</m>) in any connected planar graph?  Let's investigate this.  For each planar graph, we can associate a triple <m>(v,e,f)</m> containing the number of vertices, edges and faces.  For example, the triple for <m>K_4</m> drawn above is <m>(4,6,4)</m>.
    </p>
          <activity>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Draw a lot of planar graphs and for each record the triple <m>(v,e,f)</m>.  What triples are possible? Is there a graph with the triple <m>(5, 9, 6)</m>?  What about <m>(5,7,5)</m>?
        </p>
            </statement>
          </activity>
          <p>
      If we want to understand the relationship between the number of vertices, edges and faces of a planar graph, we could first try to decide which triples can be realized by a graph and which cannot.  At first this might seem like a daunting task.  The key is to think of it recursively.  Perhaps start with simple graphs and build up to more complicated ones.

            Start with a single pair of adjacent vertices (that is, the graph <m>P_1</m>).  What is <m>(v,e,f)</m>?  What happens to the triple if you extend the path to <m>P_2</m>?  How do <m>v</m>, <m>e</m>, and <m>f</m> change?

            You could add another vertex and edge to <m>P_2</m> (which would either give <m>P_3</m> or a <em>star</em> graph), or you could add an edge connecting two vertices not already adjacent.  What would these two operations do to <m>(v,e,f)</m>?

            Generalize.  Say you know a specific triple <m>(a,b,c)</m> describes a graph <m>G</m>.  Give two new triples that also describe some graphs, each with one more edge than <m>G</m>.

          <p>
      It appears that whenever <m>(v,e,f)</m> describes some graph, then there is a graph with triple <m>(v+1, e+1, f)</m> and a graph with triple <m>(v,e+1, f+1)</m>.  Perhaps there are other ways we could add an edge we haven't thought of yet, but so far it seems like this completely describes how any triple must be created.
    </p>
          <p>
      If this is the case, what could we conclude?  Every time we add an edge, either the number of vertices or the number of faces increases by 1.  Perhaps then <m>e = v + f</m>?  But this is not true, since for <m>P_1</m> we would have <m>1 = 2 + 1</m>, clearly false.  Okay, at least we might guess <m>v + f - e</m> is constant.  And from <m>P_1</m>, we see that constant would need to be <m>2 + 1 - 1 = 2</m>.  This leads us to conjecture the following theorem.
    </p>
          <theorem xml:id="thm-eulerformula">
            <statement>
              <p>
          For any planar graph with <m>v</m> vertices, <m>e</m> edges, and <m>f</m> faces, we have
          <me>
            v - e + f = 2

          <p>
      We will soon see that this really is a theorem.  The equation <m>v-e+f = 2</m> is called <term>Euler's formula for planar graphs</term>.  To prove this, we will want to somehow capture the idea of building up more complicated graphs from simpler ones.  That is a job for mathematical induction!

      The proof technique we will use to establish Euler's formula for planar graphs is called <term>mathematical induction</term>.  This is a technique we use many times throughout our studies, so let's take a few moments to understand the logical structure for this style of proof and why it is a valid proof technique.  Additional general practice on induction can be found in <xref ref="sec_background-induction"/>.

          <p>
      We often wish to prove a statement is true for all natural numbers <m>n</m> (or all integers larger than some smallest example).  Mathematical induction uses the fact that the (infinitely many) cases we wish to prove are in a nice order with a least element.  To show that <m>6^n</m> has units digit 6 for all <m>n \ge 1</m>, we notice that <m>6^n = 6^{n-1}\cdot 6</m>.  Assuming that we have already shown that <m>6^{n-1}</m> has units digit 6, we can multiply this number by 6, and note that the units digit will still be a 6, since the units digit of <m>x \cdot 6</m> is just 6 times the units digit of <m>x</m>, and <m>6\cdot 6</m> has units digit 6.
    </p>
          <p>
      But this seems sneaky.  Is it valid to assume that we already know the units digit of <m>6^{n-1}</m>?  That is the power of induction.
    </p>
          <p>
      Suppose we hope to prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.  What we will really prove is that <m>P(0)</m> is true, and that for all <m>k</m>, if <m>P(k-1)</m> is true, then <m>P(k)</m> is true.  In other words, we are proving the implication
      <me>
        \forall k \,(P(k) \imp P(k+1)).
      </me>
      This implication being true for all <m>k \ge 1</m> really means we have proved infinitely many implications
      <md><mrow> P(0) \imp P(1)</mrow><mrow> P(1) \imp P(2)</mrow><mrow> P(2) \imp P(3)</mrow><mrow> \vdots</mrow></md>

    </p>
          <p>
      Can we conclude <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m>?  Well take any <m>n</m>.  For example, <m>n = 3</m>.  We know <m>P(0)</m> is true, and the implication <m>P(0) \imp P(1)</m> is true, so we can conclude <m>P(1)</m>.  From <m>P(1)</m> and <m>P(1) \imp P(2)</m>, we can conclude <m>P(2)</m>.  From <m>P(2)</m> and <m>P(2) \imp P(3)</m>, we can conclude <m>P(3)</m>.  If we wanted a different value of <m>n</m>, we would just need to keep going until we got up to it.  Since every value of <m>n</m> can be reached by some finite number of steps starting at 0, we will know, for each <m>n</m> that <m>P(n)</m> is true.
    </p>
          <p>
      The above discussion is meant to explain why it is reasonable to believe that induction is a valid proof technique.<fn>Technically, induction must be assumed as an axiom or deduced from the equivalent well-ordering principle which says that every subset of <m>\N</m> contains a least element; our justification for it is circular, since to prove the justification is valid would be done by induction itself.</fn>  Once we believe induction works, we can just use it.  That means just proving two things: <m>P(0)</m> and for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, <m>P(n) \imp P(n+1)</m>.  We call <m>P(0)</m> the <term>base case</term> and the implication the <term>inductive case</term>.  Here is an example of what a proof by induction looks like.
    </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
          Prove by induction that for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, the number <m>n^2 + n</m> is even.
        </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
          First note that induction is NOT necessary here.  We could give a non-inductive prove as follows.
        </p>
              <proof>
                <p>
            Fix <m>n \ge 0</m>.  Now <m>n^2 + n = n(n+1)</m>.  Either <m>n</m> or <m>(n+1)</m> is even, and the product of an even number and an odd number is even, so <m>n^2 + n</m> is even.
          </p>
              </proof>
              <p>
          To contrast, here is a proof by induction.
        </p>
              <proof>
                <p>
            First note that <m>0^2 + 0 = 0</m> is even, so the case when <m>n = 0</m> is true.  Now assume for an arbitrary <m>n\ge 0</m> that <m>n^2 + n</m> is even.  Consider the case for <m>n+1</m>:
            <md><mrow>(n+1)^2 + n+1 \amp = n^2 + 2n + 1 + n + 1</mrow><mrow>\amp = n^2 + n + 2n + 2.</mrow></md>
            But <m>n^2 + n</m> is even, and <m>2n + 2</m> is even, and the sum of two even numbers is even, so <m>(n+1)^2 + n+1</m> is even.
          </p>
              </proof>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
      Now that we have some sense for mathematical induction in general, let's consider how induction can be applied in graph theory.
    </p>
          <p>
      First, we need something to play the role of <m>n</m>, since induction is used to prove statements are true for all natural numbers <m>n</m>.  For the most part, we cannot think of all graphs as lined up in some natural order.  But we could use induction <em>on</em> the number of edges of a graph (or number of vertices, or any other notion of size).  That is we can prove that for all <m>n\ge 0</m>, all graphs with <m>n</m> edges have <ellipsis/>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Notice that the thing we are proving for all <m>n</m> is itself a universally quantified statement. This means that our base case become, <q>for all graphs with 0 edges <ellipsis/></q> (which for not-necessarily connected graphs is infinitely many graphs).  To prove the inductive case we <em>get to</em> assume that for all graphs with <m>n</m> edges <ellipsis/>, but then we <em>must</em> prove that for all graphs with <m>n+1</m> edges <ellipsis/>.
    </p>
          <p>
      Because of this added complication, the usual way to approach the inductive case for graphs is to start with an arbitrary graph that has <m>n+1</m> edges.  Then remove an edge to drop down to a graph with <m>n</m> edges, which we know something about (our inductive hypothesis).  Then make sure that moving back to the original graph, we maintain our desired property.
    </p>
          <p>
      Let's try a simple example.
    </p>
          <activity>
            <introduction>
              <p>
          Recall that a <term>tree</term> is a connected graph with no cycles.  We wish to prove that every tree with <m>v = n</m> vertices has <m>e = n-1</m> edges.  (This is actually a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, as a tree will always be a planar graph with 1 face).
        </p>

              <statement>

          <title>Proof of Euler's formula for planar graphs.</title>
          <p>
    The proof we will give will be by induction on the number of edges of a graph.  This means we will need a way to reduce the number of edges, so we can get down to our inductive hypothesis.  There are two ways to remove an edge that will be useful here and for future problems.
  </p>
          <p>
    <idx><h>deletion</h></idx>
    A <term>deletion</term> is the result of removing an edge from the edge set (everything else in the graph stays the same).  For a specific edge <m>e</m> in the graph <m>G</m>, we write the new graph as <m>G - e</m>.
  </p>
          <p>
    <idx><h>contraction</h></idx>
    Slightly more complicated is a <term>contraction</term>.  The idea is we take an edge and shrink it down to a vertex.  The two endpoints of the vertex collide and all their incident edges follow along and become incident to this new vertex consisting of the edge and two vertices contracted together.  The resulting graph is written <m>G/e</m> (read <q><m>G</m> contract <m>e</m></q>).
  </p>
          <p>
    To be a little more precise, given a graph <m>G</m> and edge <m>e = \{u,v\}</m>, the graph <m>G/e</m> is formed by
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          Removing vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> and all their incident vertices.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Adding a new vertex <m>E</m> and edges from <m>E</m> to each vertex that was previously adjacent to <m>u</m> or <m>v</m>.
        </p>
      </li></ol>
    Notice that <m>G/e</m> might be a multigraph (if <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> were both adjacent to a common vertex).  If <m>G</m> was already a multigraph, and had two edges connecting <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, then <m>E</m> will get a loop (since only one of the edges was contracted).  We can avoid multigraphs by being careful which edge we contract along.

              <p>
        You can take <m>n = e = 1</m> as your base case.  For the inductive case, start with an arbitrary graph with <m>n</m> edges.  Consider two cases: either <m>G</m> contains a cycle or it does not.

          <p>
    It is a good exercise to give proofs by induction on the number of vertices or the number of faces.  You will need to think about how to remove a vertex or a face, and how doing so changes the other quantities.

  Euler's formula (<m>v - e + f = 2</m>) holds for all <em>connected</em> planar graphs. What if a graph is not connected? Suppose a planar graph has two components. What is the value of <m>v - e + f</m> now? What if it has <m>k</m> components?
  </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
  <p>
  Say the first component has <m>v_1</m> vertices, <m>e_1</m> edges and <m>f_1</m> faces. The second graph has <m>v_2</m> vertices, <m>e_2</m> edges and <m>f_2</m> faces. Thinking of each of these separately, we have
  <me>
    v_1 - e_1 + f_1 = 2,
  </me>
  </p>
  <me>
    v_2 - e_2 + f_2 = 2.
  </me>
  <p>
  Adding these two equations gives
  <me>
    v - e + f = 4
  </me>
  </p>

  <p>
  (since the graph has <m>v = v_1 + v_2</m> vertices, etc). However, the two components have one common face (the outside of one of them must be contained in one of the faces of the other) so in fact we get
  <me>
    v - e + f = 3.
  </me>
  </p>

  <p>
  In general, a planar graph with <m>k</m> components will satisfy <m>v - e + f = 1 + k</m>.

            The graph <m>K_5</m> has <m>5</m> vertices and 10 edges.  Explain why it would need to have <m>7</m> faces if it were planar.

                <p>
            The proof is by contradiction. So assume that <m>K_5</m> is planar. Then the graph must satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. <m>K_5</m> has 5 vertices and 10 edges, so we get
            <me>
            5 - 10 + f = 2
            </me>
            which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing, there would be <m>f = 7</m> faces.

            Now get at the number of faces another way: each face must be bordered by at least three edges.  Why?  Explain why we can conclude that <m>3f \le 2e</m>.  Where does the 2 come from?

              <solution>
                <p>
            Now consider how many edges surround each face. Each face must be surrounded by at least 3 edges. Let <m>B</m> be the total number of <em>boundaries</em> around all the faces in the graph. Thus we have that <m>B \ge 3f</m>. But also <m>B = 2e</m>, since each edge is used as a boundary exactly twice. Putting this together we get
            <me>
            3f \le 2e

              <statement>
                <p>
            We now have that for <m>K_5</m>, the number of faces is <m>f = 7</m>, and also <m>3f \le 20</m>.  How is this possible?  What can we conclude?

              <solution>
                <p>
            This is impossible, since we have already determined that <m>f = 7</m> and <m>e = 10</m>, and <m>21 \not\le 20</m>. This is a contradiction so in fact <m>K_5</m> is not planar.

      Before proceeding, consider carefully the style of proof used here.  This is a <term>proof by contradiction</term>.  We assumed the opposite of what we wanted to show.

      In a proof by contradiction, we assume <m>P</m> (which will be the negation of our desired conclusion) and derive <m>Q</m>, a contradiction.  That valid derivation allows us to conclude <m>P \imp Q</m> is <em>true</em>!  But we know that <m>Q</m> is false.  What does that say about <m>P</m>?  If the implication is true and the consequent (<q>then</q> part) is false, it must be that we are in row 4 of the truth table.  In that row, <m>P</m> is false.  So we are justified in concluding <m>\neg P</m>.
    </p>
          <p>
      In our case, <m>P</m> was the statement <q><m>K_5</m> is planar.</q>  So when we get a contradiction (a false <m>Q</m>), we can conclude that <m>K_5</m> is not planar.  Note that even though we are proving something about a graph that does not satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs, by using a proof by contradiction, we get to <em>use</em> the formula.

      If a graph contains a non-planar subgraph, then the graph cannot itself be planar.  This gives us another method of proving a given graph is not planar: find a non-planar graph, perhaps <m>K_5</m> or <m>K_{3,3}</m> inside it.
    </p>
          <p>
      From the other direction, you can think of starting with <m>K_5</m> or <m>K_{3,3}</m> and adding edges as well as adding vertices in the middle of edges (called <term>subdividing</term> the edge) to build a larger graph that is definitely not planar.  Surprisingly, <em>every</em> non-planar graph arises this way, a result called <em>Kuratowski's Theorem</em>.

  A cube<idx><h>cube</h></idx> is an example of a convex polyhedron. It contains 6 identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. The cube is a <term>regular polyhedron</term> (also known as a <term>Platonic solid</term><idx><h>Platonic solids</h></idx>) because each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.
  </p>
              <p>
  There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each of these have?

A <term>polyhedron</term><idx><h>polyhedron</h></idx> is a geometric solid made up of flat polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices.

</p>
          <p>
Notice that since <m>8 - 12 + 6 = 2</m>, the vertices, edges and faces of a cube satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. This is not a coincidence. We can represent a cube as a planar graph by projecting the vertices and edges onto the plane. One such projection looks like this:

In fact, <em>every</em> convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and <q>stretch</q> the sphere to lay down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes the <q>outside</q> face of the planar graph.
</p>
          <p>
The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler's formula for planar graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra. For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33/2 edges.
</p>
          <example>
            <statement>

Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six pentagons? What about three triangles, six pentagons and five heptagons (7-sided polygons)?
</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
How many edges would such polyhedra have? For the first proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total of 9 edges, and the pentagons would contribute 30. However, this counts each edge twice (as each edge borders exactly two faces), giving 39/2 edges, an impossibility. There is no such polyhedron.
</p>
              <p>
The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle. The extra 35 edges contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74/2 = 37 edges. So far so good. Now how many vertices does this supposed polyhedron have? We can use Euler's formula. There are 14 faces, so we have <m>v - 37 + 14 = 2</m> or equivalently <m>v = 25</m>. But now use the vertices to count the edges again. Each vertex must have degree <em>at least</em> three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since the interior angle of all the polygons must be less that <m>180^\circ</m>), so the sum of the degrees of vertices is at least 75. Since the sum of the degrees must be exactly twice the number of edges, this says that there are strictly more than 37 edges. Again, there is no such polyhedron.

Say the last polyhedron has <m>n</m> edges, and also <m>n</m> vertices. The total number of edges the polyhedron has then is <m>(7 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 4 + n)/2 = (37 + n)/2</m>. In particular, we know the last face must have an odd number of edges. We also have that <m> v = 11 </m>.  By Euler's formula, we have <m>11 - (37+n)/2 + 12 = 2</m>, and solving for <m>n</m> we get <m>n = 5</m>, so the last face is a pentagon.

We can use Euler's formula to find that there are 6 vertices (and this shows that each vertex is the joining of 4 triangles).

            The traditional design of a soccer ball is in fact a (spherical projection of a) truncated icosahedron. This consists of 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. No two pentagons are adjacent (so the edges of each pentagon are shared only by hexagons). How many vertices, edges, and faces does a truncated icosahedron have? Explain how you arrived at your answers. Bonus: draw the planar graph representation of the truncated icosahedron.

              Well, right off we know that the truncated icosahedron has <m>12+20=32</m> faces by counting the number of pentagons and hexagons. Now, because we know that every connected planar graph with <m>V</m> vertices, <m>E</m> edges and <m>F</m> faces satisfied <m>V - E + F = 2</m>, we only really need to find out the number of edges or the number of vertices since <m>V-E=-30</m>. So, let's maybe try to figure out the number of edges we have. If we think about the number of total edges when the pentagons and hexagons are not attached, we know that we have <m>5\times 12+6\times 20=180</m>. But each of these edges is shared with another edge, which means that we have cut the number of edges in half. So, we have <m>90</m> edges, which then gives us <m>60</m> vertices.

Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty, they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use and still accomplish this task?

Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.
</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.
</p>
          <p>
How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.
</p>
          <p>
In general, given any graph <m>G</m>, a coloring of the vertices with <m>k</m> colors is called a <term><m>k</m>-coloring</term><idx><h>vertex coloring</h></idx><idx><h><m>k</m>-coloring</h></idx>. If the coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called <term>proper</term>. Every graph has a proper <m>k</m>-coloring for some <m>k</m>. For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better.
The smallest <m>k</m> for which there is a proper <m>k</m>-coloring is called the <term>chromatic number</term><idx><h>chromatic number</h></idx> of the graph, written <m>\chi(G)</m><notation><usage>\chi(G)</usage><description>the chromatic number of <m>G</m></description></notation>.

The graph on the left is <m>K_6</m>. The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.
</p>
              <p>
The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:
</p>
              <sidebyside width="25%">
                <image>
                  <latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=.8]

	    \end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
                </image>
              </sidebyside>
              <p>
There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.
</p>
              <p>
The graph on the right is just <m>K_{2,3}</m>. As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.
</p>
            </solution>
          </example>
          <p>
It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get; the graph <m>K_n</m> has chromatic number <m>n</m>. So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map. But there is.
</p>
          <p>
The key observation is that while it is true that for any number <m>n</m>, there is a graph with chromatic number <m>n</m>, only some graphs arrive as representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all <em>planar</em>!
</p>
          <p>
So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph? The answer is the infamous Four Color Theorem.
</p>
          <theorem>
            <title>The Four Color Theorem</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
<idx><h>Four Color Theorem</h></idx>
If <m>G</m> is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.
</p>
            </statement>
          </theorem>
          <p>
We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no <q>easy</q> known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check an <em>unavoidable set</em> of 633 <em>reducible configurations</em>. The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.
</p>
          <p>
  Of course if every planar graph has chromatic number at most 4, then every graph has chromatic number no more than 6.  Proving this (even without using the 4 color theorem) is not very difficult, and this at least shows that the chromatic numbers for planar graphs is bounded.

	    You will want to use a proof by induction on the number of vertices.  Use the fact that every planar graph has at least one vertex of degree at most 5.

	    Note first that any graph with one vertex can be properly 6-colored (the base case).  Now let <m>G</m> be an arbitrary graph with <m>n</m> vertices, and assume that any graph with fewer than <m>n</m> vertices can be properly 6-colored.  Let <m>v</m> be a vertex of <m>G</m> of degree 5 or less.  
	  </p>
              <p>
			Consider the graph <m>G' = G - v</m> (the graph resulting from removing <m>v</m> and all its incident edges from <m>G</m>).  Since <m>G'</m> has <m>n-1</m> vertices, it is possible to properly 6-color its vertices.  Looking back at <m>G</m>, we see that <m>v</m> is only adjacent to at most 5 vertices, so there are at most 5 colors we cannot use to color <m>v</m>.  But we have 6 colors to work with, so we will be able to color <m>v</m>, and thus all of <m>G</m>, properly.

  In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a proof of the Four Color Theorem.  It wasn't until 11 years later that Percy John Heawood found an error in the proof.  However, the failed proof did lead to a nice proof that every planar graph has chromatic number at most five.  The next activity walks you through that proof.

Represent the problem as a graph with vertices as the stations and edges when two stations are close enough to cause interference. We are looking for the chromatic number of the graph. Vertices that are colored identically represent stations that can have the same frequency.
</p>
              <p>
This graph has chromatic number 5. A proper 5-coloring is shown on the right. Notice that the graph contains a copy of the complete graph <m>K_5</m> so no fewer than 5 colors can be used.

In the example above, the chromatic number was 5, but this is not a counterexample to the Four Color Theorem, since the graph representing the radio stations is not planar. It would be nice to have some quick way to find the chromatic number of a (possibly non-planar) graph. It turns out nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic numbers exists.
</p>
          <p>
While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of graph easily, we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number. In other words, we can give upper and lower bounds for chromatic number.
</p>
          <p>
This is actually not very difficult: for every graph <m>G</m>, the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is at least 1 and at most the number of vertices of <m>G</m>.

  Graphs that do not contain <m>K_3</m> are called <term>triangle-free</term>.  In 1955, Jan Mycielski gave a construction which when applied to any triangle-free graph with chromatic number <m>n</m> produced a triangle-free graph with chromatic number <m>n+1</m> (the resulting graph is called the <term>Mycielskian</term> of the original graph).  This proves that the there are graphs without even <m>K_3</m> that have arbitrarily high chromatic number, so the difference between the clique number and chromatic number can be arbitrarily large.

There are times when the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is <em>equal</em> to the clique number. These graphs have a special name; they are called <term>perfect</term><idx><h>perfect graph</h></idx> (actually for a graph to be perfect, every induced subgraph must have this property). If you know that a graph is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply a matter of searching for the largest clique.<fn>There are special classes of graphs which can be proved to be perfect.  One such class is the set of <term>chordal</term> graphs, which have the property that every cycle in the graph contains a <term>chord</term><mdash/>an edge between two vertices of the cycle which are not adjacent in the cycle.</fn> However, not all graphs are perfect, and searching for the largest clique isn't always easy anyway.

  What about an upper bound?  For planar graphs, <m>\chi(G) \le 4</m>.  Also, if a graph has a proper <m>k</m>-coloring, then <m>\chi(G) \le k</m>, but this requires attempting a coloring first.  Can we do better? It is helpful to recall our attempts to prove the 6- and 5-color theorems.

			Find a vertex of <m>G</m> with degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> and remove it. This forms a subgraph <m>G'</m> which has <m>n-1</m> vertices. Also, since we removed edges, we know that <m>\Delta(G') \le \Delta(G)</m>. If these maximal degrees are equal, then <m>G'</m> must also have a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>, since at least one of its vertices had one more edge in <m>G</m>. In this case, we can apply our inductive hypothesis to produce a coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors. If <m>\Delta(G') \lt  \Delta(G)</m>, then we also can easily find a proper coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors by starting with any vertex and coloring it and all of its neighbors differently, and then fanning out. Thus <m>G'</m> has a proper vertex coloring using just <m>\Delta(G)</m>-many colors.
</p>
                <p>
			Now move back to <m>G</m>. Put the removed vertex back into the graph. Since it is adjacent to at most <m>\Delta(G) - 1</m> other vertices, there will be one of the <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors that is not present among its neighbors, which we could use to color the newly inserted vertex.

          <title>Coloring Edges</title>
          <p>
The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here, we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the edges of a graph <m>G</m> is called the <term>chromatic index</term><idx><h>chromatic index</h></idx> of <m>G</m>, written <m>\chi'(G)</m><notation><usage>\chi'(G)</usage><description>the chromatic index of <m>G</m></description></notation>.

              <p>
We must color the edges; each color represents a different hour. Since different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored differently, no player will be playing two different games (edges) at the same time. Thus we need to know the chromatic index of <m>K_6</m>.
</p>
              <p>
Notice that for sure <m>\chi'(K_6) \ge 5</m>, since there is a vertex of degree 5. It turns out 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring). Therefore the friends will play for 5 hours.

Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5 chess-letes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of <m>K_5</m> is also 5.

In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly <m>\chi'(G) \ge \Delta(G)</m>. But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.

              <p>
<idx><h>Vizing's Theorem</h></idx>
For any graph <m>G</m>, the chromatic index <m>\chi'(G)</m> is either <m>\Delta(G)</m> or <m>\Delta(G) + 1</m>.
</p>
            </statement>
          </theorem>
          <p>
At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which <m>\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)</m> are called <em>class 1</em>, while the others are called <em>class 2</em>. Bipartite graphs always satisfy <m>\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)</m>, so are class 1 (this was proved by K√∂nig in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with <m>\Delta(G) \ge 8</m> are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with <m>2 \le \Delta(G) \le 5</m>. Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with <m>\Delta(G) = 6</m> or <m>\Delta(G) = 7</m> are class 1; the <m>\Delta(G) = 7</m> case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the <m>\Delta(G) = 6</m> case is still open.

If person A is acquainted with six or more people, then among these six people, there are either three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. If there are three mutual strangers, we are done; if there are three mutual acquaintances, they, together with Person A are four mutual acquaintances.

If two of these people are strangers, then they, together with person A form three mutual strangers and we are done. Otherwise all of these people know each other and we have at least four mutual acquaintances, and so in every possible situation, we have either four mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers.

				You cannot find either.

Thus you can assume your set of four acquaintances contains person 1 and two from among persons 2, 3, 5, and 9. However persons 2 and 5, 2 and 9 and 3 and 9 are not acquainted. Thus three of the mutually acquainted people are either persons 1, 2, and 3, persons 1, 5 and 9 or persons 1, 3, and 5. However person 5 is not acquainted with the person one, two, or eight places to the left of person 1, so if person 5 is in the set of mutual acquaintances, then person 14 must be as well. However person 3 and person 9 are not acquainted with person 14. Thus our set must contain persons 1, 2, and 3. However person 3 is not acquainted with the person one, two, four, or eight persons to the left of person 1, so there is no set of four mutual acquaintances. A similar argument holds for non-acquaintances.

        <title>Matching in Bipartite Graphs</title>
        <p>
  In any <term>matching</term> is a subset <m>M</m> of the edges for which no two edges of <m>M</m> are incident to a common vertex.  If every vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges, we say the matching is <term>perfect</term>. Our goal is to discover some criterion for when a bipartite graph has a prefect matching.
</p>
        <p>
  <idx><h>matching</h></idx>
Suppose you have a bipartite graph <m>G</m>. This will consist of two sets of vertices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with some edges connecting some vertices of <m>A</m> to some vertices in <m>B</m> (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in <m>A</m> or both in <m>B</m>). A <term>matching</term> of <m>G</m> is a set of <term>independent edges</term>, meaning no two edges in the set are adjacent.  If every vertex in <m>G</m> is incident to exactly one edge in the matching, we call the matching <term>perfect</term>.
If a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, then <m>\card{A} = \card{B}</m>, but in general, we could have a <term>matching of <m>A</m></term>, which will mean that every vertex in <m>A</m> is incident to an edge in the matching.
</p>
        <p>
Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in <m>A</m> as representing students in a class, and the vertices in <m>B</m> as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex <m>a \in A</m> to a vertex <m>b \in B</m> if student <m>a</m> would like to present on topic <m>b</m>. Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of <m>A</m>: you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.<fn>The standard example for matchings used to be the <em>marriage problem</em> in which <m>A</m> consisted of the men in the town, <m>B</m> the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties.  A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed.</fn>

      The first and third graphs have a matching, shown in bold (there are other matchings as well). The middle graph does not have a matching. If you look at the three circled vertices, you see that they only have two neighbors, which violates the matching condition <m>\card{N(S)} \ge \card{S}</m> (the three circled vertices form the set <m>S</m>).

One way <m>G</m> could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in <m>A</m> not adjacent to any vertex in <m>B</m> (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students.

        <p>
It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of <m>n</m> students who as a group like <m>n-1</m> or fewer topics, then no matching is possible. This is true for any value of <m>n</m>, and any group of <m>n</m> students.

Does that mean that there is a matching? Surprisingly, yes. The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient.<fn>This happens often in graph theory.

      One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an <term>alternating path</term>. This is a path whose adjacent edges alternate between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching (no edge can be used more than once, since this is a path). If an alternating path starts and stops with vertices that are <em>not</em> matched, (that is, these vertices are not incident to any edge in the matching) then the path is called an <term>augmenting path</term>.

  If a graph does not have a perfect matching, then any of its maximal matchings must leave a vertex unmatched.  In particular, there cannot be an augmenting path starting at such a vertex (otherwise the maximal matching would not be maximal).  Thus to prove <xref ref="thm-hallmarriage"/>, it would be sufficient to prove that the matching condition guarantees that every non-perfect matching has an augmenting path.

Suppose you deal 52 regular playing cards into 13 piles of 4 cards each. Prove that you can always select one card from each pile to get one of each of the 13 card values Ace, 2, 3, <ellipsis/>, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.
</p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
    Take <m>A</m> to be the 13 piles and <m>B</m> to be the 13 values.  What would the matching condition need to say, and why is it satisfied.
  </p>
          </hint>
          <solution>
            <p>
Doing this directly would be difficult, but we can use the matching condition to help. Construct a graph <m>G</m> with 13 vertices in the set <m>A</m>, each representing one of the 13 card values, and 13 vertices in the set <m>B</m>, each representing one of the 13 piles. Draw an edge between a vertex <m>a \in A</m> to a vertex <m>b \in B</m> if a card with value <m>a</m> is in the pile <m>b</m>. Notice that we are just looking for a matching of <m>A</m>; each value needs to be found in the piles exactly once.
</p>
            <p>
We will have a matching if the matching condition holds. Given any set of card values (a set <m>S \subseteq A</m>) we must show that <m>|N(S)| \ge |S|</m>. That is, the number of piles that contain those values is at least the number of different values. But what if it wasn't? Say <m>|S| = k</m>. If <m>|N(S)| \lt  k</m>, then we would have fewer than <m>4k</m> different cards in those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards). But there are <m>4k</m> cards with the <m>k</m> different values, so at least one of these cards must be in another pile, a contradiction. Thus the matching condition holds, so there is a matching, as required.

      The reason the sentence <q><m>3 + x = 12</m></q>

      Depending on what
      <m>x</m> is, the sentence is either true or false,
      but right now it is neither.
      One way to make the <em>sentence</em>
      into a <em>statement</em>
      is to specify the value of the variable in some way.
      This could be done by specifying a specific substitution,
      for example,
      <q><m>3+x = 12</m> where <m>x = 9</m>,</q>
      which is a true statement.
      Or you could <em>capture</em> the free variable by
      <em>quantifying</em> over it, as in,
      <q>for all values of <m>x</m>,
      <m>3+x = 12</m>,</q> which is false.
      We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.

      You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler
      (atomic or molecular)
      ones using

              <p permid="nTq">

            </blockquote>
            <p permid="FBv">
      Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements.
      The two shorter statements are
      <em>connected</em> by an
      <q>and.</q> We will consider 5 connectives:
      <q>and</q> (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman),
      <q>or</q> (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman),
      <q>if<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/></q>
      (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman),
      <q>if and only if</q> (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and
      <q>not</q> (Sam is not a man).
      The first four are called
      <term>binary connectives</term>
      (because they connect two statements)
      while
      <q>not</q> is an example of a
      <term>unary connective</term>
      (since it applies to a single statement).
    </p>
            <p permid="lIE">
      These molecular statements are of course still statements,
      so they must be either true or false.
      The absolutely key observation here is that which <term>truth value</term> 
          <idx><h>truth value</h></idx>
      the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts.
      We do not need to know what the parts actually say,
      only whether those parts are true or false.
      So to analyze logical connectives,
      it is enough to consider <term>propositional variables</term>
      (sometimes called <em>sentential</em> variables),
      usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet:
      <m>P, Q, R, S, \ldots</m>.
      We think of these as standing in for
      (usually atomic)
      statements, but there are only two <em>values</em>
      the variables can achieve: true or false.<fn>

      Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication.
      Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart.
      Consider the <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em>.
      Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as
      <q><m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      This is absolutely not correct.
      For one thing,
      that is not a statement since it has three variables in it.
      Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables?
      So <m>1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2</m>??? How can we fix this?
      Well, the equation is true as long as <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs or a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the hypotenuse.
      In other words:
    </p>
            <blockquote permid="pPH">
              <p permid="Uaz">
        <em>If</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>,
        <em>then </em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.
      </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p permid="Klo">
      This is a reasonable way to think about implications:
      our claim is that the conclusion (<q>then</q> part) is true,
      but on the assumption that the hypothesis (<q>if</q> part) is true.
      We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.<fn>
      However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem,
      it is also the case that <em>if</em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>,
      <em>then</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>.
      So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional:
      <q><m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m> <em>if and only if</em>
      <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      </fn></p>
            <p permid="qsx">
      Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement,
      and therefore is either true or false.
      The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts.
      To agree with the usage above,
      we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false,
      or when the conclusion is true.
      This leaves only one way for an implication to be false:
      when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.

          Suppose I made that statement to Bob.

          What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final,
          and he did pass the class?
          Then I have not lied; my statement is true.
          However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class,
          then I lied, making the statement false.
          The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final?
          Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't.
          Did I lie in either case?
          I think not.
          In these last two cases,
          <m>P</m> was false, and the statement <m>P \imp Q</m> was true.

      It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true,

      However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true.

      The contrapositive, on the other hand,

      part or the <q>only if</q> part?
      Consider an example.

          Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower.
          We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower,
          and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing.
          Let <m>P</m> be the statement,
          <q>I sing,</q> and <m>Q</m> be,
          <q>I'm in the shower.</q> So
          <m>P \imp Q</m> is the statement <q>if I sing,

                <p permid="iee">
          What we are really asking for is the meaning of <q>I sing

          I'm in the shower.</q> When is the first one
          (the <q>if</q> part)
          <em>false</em>?
          When I am in the shower but not singing.
          That is the same condition on being false as the statement
          <q>if I'm in the shower,
          then I sing.</q> So the <q>if</q> part is <m>Q \imp P</m>.
          On the other hand, to say,

          is equivalent to saying <q>if I sing,

      It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences.
      For example,
      suppose we wanted to claim that if <m>n</m> is prime,
      then <m>n+7</m> is not prime.
      This looks like an implication.
      I would like to write something like
      <me permid="tWX">
        P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
      </me>
      where <m>P(n)</m> means <q> <m>n</m> is prime.</q>
      But this is not quite right.
      For one thing, because this sentence has a
      <term>free variable</term>
      (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about),
      it is not a statement.  A sentence that contains variables is called a <term>predicate</term>.
    </p>
            <p permid="cYM">
      Now, if we plug in a specific value for <m>n</m>, we do get a statement.
      In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for <m>n</m>,
      we get a true implication in this case.
      What we really want to say is that
      <em>for all</em> values of <m>n</m>,
      if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n+7</m> is not.
      We need to <em>quantify</em> the variable.

      As with all mathematical statements,
      we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false.
      Consider the statement
      <me permid="msy">
        \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
      </me>.
      You would read this,
      <q>for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> such that <m>y</m> is less than <m>x</m>.</q> Is this true?
      The answer depends on what our <em>domain of discourse</em> is:
      when we say <q>for all</q> <m>x</m>,
      do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set?
      Usually this information is implied.
      In discrete mathematics,
      we almost always quantify over the
      <em>natural numbers</em>, 0, 1, 2,
      <ellipsis/>, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.
    </p>
            <p permid="Vun">
      For the statement to be true,
      we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select,
      there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller.
      Perhaps we could let
      <m>y</m> be
      <m>x-1</m>?
      But here is the problem: what if
      <m>x = 0</m>?
      Then
      <m>y = -1</m> and that is
      <em>not a number!</em>
      (in our domain of discourse).
      Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers.
      In symbols,

            <p permid="BBw">
      To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the
      <em>negation</em> was true.
      Notice how the negation and original statement compare.
      This is typical.

      Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier,

      This should not be surprising:

      It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.  Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention.  An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified. 
    </p>
              <p permid="rxQ">
      For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <m>S(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a square</q> and <m>R(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a rectangle</q>.  The <em>sentence</em> we are looking at is,
      
      <me permid="yGQ">
        S(x) \imp R(x)
      </me>.
      This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,
      
      <me permid="eNZ">
        \forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))
      </me>,
      
      and this is what our convention tells us to consider.
    </p>
              <p permid="XEZ">
      Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, <em>let <m>P(n)</m> be the <em>statement</em>, <q><m>n</m> is prime,</q></em> which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <m>P(n)</m> to be a predicate, which for each <m>n</m> becomes the statement, <m>n</m> is prime.

      a.  This is not a statement. It is an imperative sentence, but is not either true or false. It doesn't matter that this might actually be the rule or not. Note that "The rule is that all customers must wear shoes" _is_ a statement.
      
      a.  This is a statement, as it is either true or false. It is an atomic statement because it cannot be divided into smaller statements.
      
      a.  This is again a statement, but this time it is molecular. In fact, it is a conjunction, as we can write it as "The customers wore shoes and the customers wore socks."

      Determine whether each molecular statement below is true or false, or whether it is impossible to determine. Assume you do not know what my favorite number is (but you do know that 13 is prime).

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      a.  It is impossible to tell. The hypothesis of the implication is true. Thus the implication will be true if the conclusion is true (if 13 _is_ my favorite number) and false otherwise.
      
      a.  This is true, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not. Any implication with a true conclusion is true.
      
      a.  This is true, again, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not. Any implication with a false hypothesis is true.
      
      a.  For a disjunction to be true, we just need one or the other (or both) of the parts to be true. Thus this is a true statement.
      
      a.  We cannot tell. The statement would be true if 13 is my favorite number, and false if not (since a conjunction needs both parts to be true to be true).
      
      a.  This is definitely false. 13 is prime, so its negation (13 is not prime) is false. At least one part of the conjunction is false, so the whole statement is false.
      
      a.  This is true. Either 13 is my favorite number or it is not, but whichever it is, at least one part of the disjunction is true, so the whole statement is true.

                  The main thing to realize is that we don't know the colors of these two shapes,
                  but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a blue square and green triangle.
                  We could have a square that was not blue but a green triangle.
                  Or we could have a square that was not blue and a triangle that was not green.
                  The case in which the square is blue but the triangle is not green cannot occur,
                  as that would make the statement false.

      In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a square, and the other is a triangle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that _if the square is blue, then the triangle is green_. What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?
      a.  The square and the triangle are both blue. [_]{$false}{5}
      
      a.  The square and the triangle are both green. [_]{$na}{5}
      
      a.  If the triangle is not green, then the square is not blue. [_]{$true}{5}
      
      a.  If the triangle is green, then the square is blue. [_]{$na}{5}
      
      a.  The square is not blue or the triangle is green. [_]{$true}{5}
      
      END_PGML

      # Solution
      ############################################################
      
      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      The main thing to realize is that we don't know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a blue square and green triangle. We could have a square that was not blue but a green triangle. Or we could have a square that was not blue and a triangle that was not green. The case in which the square is blue but the triangle is not green cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.
      a.  This must be false. In fact, this is the negation of the original implication.
      
      a.  This might be true or might be false.
      
      a.  True. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to it.
      
      a.  We do not know. This is the converse of the original statement. In particular, if the square is not blue but the triangle is green, then the original statement is true but the converse is false.
      
      a.  True. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.

      The only way for an implication [`P\imp Q`] to be true but its converse to be false is for [`Q`] to be true and [`P`] to be false. Thus:
      a.  False.

      The converse is "If I will give you magic beans, then you will give me a cow." The contrapositive is "If I will not give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow." All the other statements are neither the converse nor contrapositive.

      You have discovered an old paper on graph theory that discusses the _viscosity_ of a graph (which for all you know, is something completely made up by the author). A theorem in the paper claims that "if a graph satisfies _condition (V)_, then the graph is _viscous_." Which of the following are equivalent ways of stating this claim? Which are equivalent to the _converse_ of the claim?
      a.  A graph is viscous only if it satisfies condition (V). [_]{$converse}{5}
      
      a.  A graph is viscous if it satisfies condition (V). [_]{$original}{5}
      
      a.  For a graph to be viscous, it is necessary that it satisfies condition (V). [_]{$converse}{5}
      
      a.  For a graph to be viscous, it is sufficient for it to satisfy condition (V). [_]{$original}{5}
      
      a.  Satisfying condition (V) is a sufficient condition for a graph to be viscous. [_]{$original}{5}
      
      a.  Satisfying condition (V) is a necessary condition for a graph to be viscous. [_]{$converse}{5}
      
      a.  Every viscous graph satisfies condition (V). [_]{$converse}{5}
      
      a.  Only viscous graphs satisfy condition (V). [_]{$original}{5}

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      [`P(5)`] is the statement "[`3\cdot 5 + 1`] is even", which is true. Thus the statement [`\exists x P(x)`] is true (for example, 5 is such an [`x`]). However, we cannot tell anything about [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] since we do not know the truth value of [`P(x)`] for _all_ elements of the domain of discourse. In this case, [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] happens to be false (since [`P(4)`] is false, for example).

      For a given predicate [`P(x)\text{,}`] you might believe that the statements [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] or [`\exists x P(x)`] are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case?  You have four choices: you could give an example of an element [`n`] in the domain for which [`P(n)`] is true or for which [`P(n)`] if false, or you could argue that no matter what [`n`] is, [`P(n)`] is true or is false.
      a.  What would you need to do to prove [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] is true?

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      a.  The claim that [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] means that [`P(n)`] is true no matter what [`n`] you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] is true is to check or otherwise argue that [`P(n)`] is true for all [`n`] in the domain.
      
      a.  To prove [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which [`P(n)`] is false. This is often called a counterexample.
      
      a.  We are simply claiming that there is some element [`n`] in the domain of discourse for which [`P(n)`] is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.
      
      a.  Here we are claiming that no element we find will make [`P(n)`] true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that _every_ element of the domain makes [`P(n)`] false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x P(x)`] is true.

      a.  [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall x \exists y P(x,y)`] is false because when [`x = 4\text{,}`] there is no [`y`] which makes [`P(4,y)`] true.
      
      a.  [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\forall y \exists x P(x,y)`] is true. No matter what [`y`] is (i.e., no matter what column we are in) there is some [`x`] for which [`P(x,y)`] is true. In fact, we can always take [`x`] to be [`3\text{.}`]
      
      a.  [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\exists x \forall y P(x,y)`] is true. In particular [`x=3`] is such a number, so that no matter what [`y`] is, [`P(x,y)`] is true.
      
      a.  [`\def\d{\displaystyle}\def\course{Math 228}\newcommand{\f}[1]{\mathfrak #1}\exists y \forall x P(x,y)`] is false. In fact, no matter what [`y`] (column) we look at, there is always some [`x`] (row) which makes [`P(x,y)`] false.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the implication, <q>if you clean your room,
        then you can watch TV.</q> Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible.
        Then do the same for the converse.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Of course there are many answers.
        It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true.
        Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways.
        Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language,
        use <q>only if,</q> consider negations,
        use <q>or else</q> language.

            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

          <title>Sets</title>
          <introduction permid="Ehu">
            <p permid="HEQ">
      The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies
      (and really in all of math)
      are
      <em>sets</em>.
      Much of what follows might be review,
      but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory.
      Most of the notation we use below is standard,
      although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.
    </p>
            <p permid="nLZ">
      For us, a <term>set</term> 
          <idx><h>set</h></idx>
      will simply be an unordered collection of objects.
      Two examples:
      we could consider the set of all actors who have played
      <em>The Doctor</em> on <em>Doctor Who</em>,
          <idx><h>Doctor Who</h></idx>
      or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive.
      In the first case, Tom Baker is a element
      (or member)
      of the set, while Idris Elba,
      among many others, is not an element of the set.
      Also, the two examples are of different sets.
      Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements.
      For example,
      the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word
      <q>questionably</q> (namely, all of them);
      we do not care about order or repetitions,
      just whether the element is in the set or not.
    </p>
          </introduction>
          <subsection xml:id="subsec_notation" permid="RBf">
            <title>Notation</title>
            <p permid="MoJ">
      We need some notation to make talking about sets easier.
      Consider,
      <me permid="gRu">
        A = \{1, 2, 3\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="svS">
      This is read,
      <q><m>A</m> is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.</q>
      We use curly braces <q><m>\{,~~ \}</m></q>
      to enclose elements of a set.
      Some more notation:
      <me permid="MYD">
        a \in \{a, b, c\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="YDb">
      The symbol <q><m>\in</m></q> is read <q>is in</q> or
      <q>is an element of.</q>
      Thus the above means that <m>a</m> is an element of the set containing the letters <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>,
      and <m>c</m>.
      Note that this is a true statement.
      It would also be true to say that <m>d</m> is not in that set:
      <me permid="tfM">
        d \not\in \{a, b, c\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="EKk">
      Be warned: we write <q><m>x \in A</m></q>
      when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set <m>A</m> is <m>x</m>.
      For example, consider the set,
      <me permid="ZmV">
        A = \{1, b, \{x, y, z\}, \emptyset\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="kRt">
      This is a strange set, to be sure.
      It contains four elements:
      the number 1, the letter b, the set <m>\{x,y,z\}</m>, and the empty set
      <m>\emptyset = \{ \}</m>, the set containing no elements.
      Is <m>x</m> in <m>A</m>?
      The answer is no.
      None of the four elements in <m>A</m> are the letter <m>x</m>,
      so we must conclude that <m>x \notin A</m>.
      Similarly, consider the set <m>B = \{1,b\}</m>.
      Even though the elements of <m>B</m> are elements of <m>A</m>,
      we cannot say that the <em>set</em>
      <m>B</m> is one of the elements of <m>A</m>.
      Therefore <m>B \notin A</m>.
      (Soon we will see that <m>B</m> is a
      <em>subset</em> of <m>A</m>,
      but this is different from being an
      <em>element</em> of <m>A</m>.)
    </p>
            <p permid="QYC">
      We have described the sets above by listing their elements.
      Sometimes this is hard to do,
      especially when there are a lot of elements in the set
      (perhaps infinitely many).
      For instance,
      if we want <m>A</m> to be the set of all even natural numbers,
      would could write,
      <me permid="Fue">
        A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\}
      </me>,
      but this is a little imprecise.
      A better way would be
      <me permid="lBn">
        A = \{x \in \N \st \exists n\in \N ( x = 2 n)\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="xfL">
      Let's look at this carefully.  First, there are some new symbols to digest: <q><m>\N</m></q> is the symbol usually used to denote that <term>natural numbers</term>, which we will take to be the set <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</m>.   Next, the colon, <q>:</q>, is read <em>such that</em>; it separates the elements that are in the set from the condition that the elements in the set must satisfy.
      
      So putting this all together, we would read the set as, <q>the set of all <m>x</m> in the natural numbers, such that there exists some <m>n</m> in the natural numbers for which <m>x</m> is twice <m>n</m>.</q> In other words, the set of all natural numbers, that are even.  Here is another way to write the same set. 
      
      <me permid="RIw">
        A = \{x \in \N \st x\text{ is even} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="dmU">
      Note: Sometimes mathematicians use <m>|</m> or
      <m>\backepsilon</m> for the <q>such that</q>
      symbol instead of the colon.
      Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether <m>0</m> is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful there.  
    </p>
            <p permid="Jud">
      This notation is usually called <term>set builder notation</term>.
      It tells use how to <em>build</em> a set by telling us pricisely the condition elements must meet to gain access
      (the condition is the logical statement after the
      <q><m>\st</m></q> symbol).  Reading and comprehending sets written in this way takes practice.

      We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal:
      they have exactly the same elements.
      Thus, for example,
      <me permid="xPF">
        \{1, 2, 3\} = \{2, 1, 3\}
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="hWN">
      (Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also,
      <me permid="dWO">
        \{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1\} = \{I, II, III\} = \{1, 2, 3, 1+2\}
      </me>
      since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers
      (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).
    </p>
            <p permid="OdW">
      What about the sets <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m>?
      Clearly <m>A \ne B</m>,
      but notice that every element of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.
      Because of this we say that <m>A</m> is a <em>subset</em>
          <idx><h>subset</h></idx>
      of <m>B</m>, or in symbols
      <m>A \subset B</m> or <m>A \subseteq B</m>.
      Both symbols are read <q>is a subset of.</q>
      The difference is that sometimes we want to say that <m>A</m> is either equal to or is a subset of <m>B</m>,
      in which case we use <m>\subseteq</m>.
      This is analogous to the difference between <m>\lt</m> and <m>\le</m>.

      <m>|B| = 3</m>, and so on.
      For sets that have a finite number of elements,
      the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set.
      Note that the cardinality of <m>\{ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}</m> is 3.
      We do not count repeats
      (in fact, <m>\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}</m> is exactly the same set as <m>\{1, 2, 3\}</m>).
      There are sets with infinite cardinality,
      such as <m>\N</m>, the set of rational numbers
      (written <m>\mathbb Q</m>),
      the set of even natural numbers,
      and the set of real numbers
      (<m>\mathbb R</m>).
      It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities,
      but that is beyond the scope of this text.
      For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite;
      if it is finite,
      the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.

            <p permid="Gzx">
      Is it possible to add two sets?
      Not really, however there is something similar.
      If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set,
      then we can take the <term>union</term>
          <idx><h>union</h></idx>
      of the two sets.
      Symbolically,
      <me permid="qlg">
        C = A \cup B
      </me>,
      read, <q><m>C</m> is the union of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,</q>
      means that the elements of <m>C</m> are exactly the elements which are either an element of <m>A</m> or an element of <m>B</m>
      (or an element of both).
      For example,
      if <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{2, 3, 4\}</m>,
      then <m>A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m>.
    </p>
            <p permid="mGG">
      The other common operation on sets is <term>intersection</term>.
          <idx><h>intersection</h></idx>
      We write,
      <me permid="Wsp">
        C = A \cap B
      </me>
      and say,
      <q><m>C</m> is the intersection of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,</q>
      when the elements in <m>C</m> are precisely those both in <m>A</m> and in <m>B</m>.
      So if <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{2, 3, 4\}</m>,
      then <m>A \cap B = \{2, 3\}</m>.
    </p>
            <p permid="SNP">
      Often when dealing with sets,
      we will have some understanding as to what <q>everything</q> is.
      Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers.
      In this case we would say that our
      <term>universe</term> is <m>\N</m>.
      Sometimes we denote this universe by <m>\U</m>.
      Given this context,
      we might wish to speak of all the elements which are
      <em>not</em> in a particular set.
      We say <m>B</m> is the <term>complement</term>
          <idx><h>complement</h></idx>
      of <m>A</m>, and write,
      <me permid="Czy">
        B = \bar A
      </me>
      when <m>B</m> contains every element not contained in <m>A</m>.
      So, if our universe is <m>\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}</m>,
      and <m>A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}</m>,
      then <m>\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}</m>.
    </p>
            <p permid="yUY">
      Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time.
      For example, consider
      <me permid="iGH">
        A \cap \bar B
      </me>.
    </p>
            <p permid="fch">
      This is the set of all elements which are both elements of <m>A</m> and not elements of <m>B</m>.
      What have we done?
      We've started with <m>A</m> and removed all of the elements which were in <m>B</m>.
      Another way to write this is the
      <term>set difference</term>:
          <idx><h>set difference</h></idx>
          <idx><h>difference, of sets</h></idx>

      It is important to remember that these operations (union,
      intersection,
      complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets.
      Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section
      (element of and subset of). <m>A \cap B</m> is a set,
      while <m>A \subseteq B</m> is true or false.
      This is the same difference as between <m>3 + 2</m>
      (which is a number)

      Each circle represents a set.
      The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe.
      To represent combinations of these sets,
      we shade the corresponding region.

      Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way.
      We could have started with all of <m>C</m>,
      then excluded the region where <m>C</m> and <m>A</m> overlap outside of <m>B</m>.
      That region is <m>(A \cap C) \cap \bar B</m>.
      So the above Venn diagram also represents <m>C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}</m>.
      So using just the picture, we have determined that
      <me permid="nqA">
        (B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A) = C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      a.  This is the set [`\{3, 4, 5, \ldots \}`] since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least three more than 2. Since [`3^2 - 3 = 6`] but [`2^2 - 3 = 1`] we see that the first such natural number is 3.
      
      a.  Here we don't specify that [`n`] must be a whole number at first, but the condition we place on it, that [`n^2 - 5 \in \N`] does guarantee this (since square a non-integer always gives a non-integer, as does subtracting 5 from a non-integer). So in fact, we get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which [`n^2 - 5`] is a natural numbers is 3.
      
          Note that if we didn't specify [`n \ge 0`] then any integer less than [`-3`] would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.
      
      a.  This is the set [`\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}`] namely the set of numbers that are the _result_ of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number. ([`0^2 + 1 = 1\text{,}`] [`1^2 + 1 = 2\text{,}`] [`2^2 + 1 = 5`] and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is 1.
      
      a.  Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1. That is, [`\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}`] the same set as the previous part. So again, the least element is 1.

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      a.  [`A \cap B`] will be the set of natural numbers that are both at least 4 and less than 12, and even. That is, [`\newcommand{\s}[1]{\mathscr #1}\newcommand{\lt}{&lt;}A \cap B = \{x \in \N \st 4\le x \lt 12 \wedge x \text{ is even}\} = \{4, 6, 8, 10\}\text{.}`]
      
      a.  [`\newcommand{\s}[1]{\mathscr #1}A \setminus B`] is the set of all elements that are in [`A`] but not [`B\text{.}`] So this is [`\newcommand{\s}[1]{\mathscr #1}\newcommand{\lt}{&lt;}\{x \in \N \st 4 \le x \lt 12 \wedge x \text{ is odd}\} = \{5,7,9,11\}\text{.}`]
      
          Note this is the same set as [`A \cap \overline{B}\text{.}`]

        We need to be a little careful here.  If <m>B</m> contains 3 elements, then <m>A</m> contains just the number 3 (listed twice).  So that would make <m>|A| = 1</m>, which would make <m>B = \{1, 3\}</m>, which only has 2 elements.  Thus <m>|B| \ne 3</m>.  This means that <m>|A| = 2</m>, so <m>B</m> contains at least the elements 1 and 2.  Since <m>\card{B} \ne 3</m>, we must have <m>\card{B} = 2</m>, which agrees with the definition of <m>B</m>.

      A <term>function</term>
          <idx><h>function</h></idx>
      is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.
      We call the output the <term>image</term> of the input.
      The set of all inputs for a function is called the
      <term>domain</term>.
          <idx><h>domain</h></idx>
      The set of all allowable outputs is called the
      <term>codomain</term>.
          <idx><h>codomain</h></idx>
      We would write <m>f:X \to Y</m> to describe a function with name <m>f</m>,
      domain <m>X</m> and codomain <m>Y</m>.
      This does not tell us <em>which</em>
      function <m>f</m> is though.
      To define the function, we must describe the rule.
      This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input
      (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).
    </p>
            <p permid="YRj">
      For example, consider the function
      <m>f:\N \to \N</m> defined by <m>f(x) = x^2 + 3</m>.
      Here the domain and codomain are the same set
      (the natural numbers).
      The rule is: take your input,
      multiply it by itself and add 3.
      This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number
      (every element of the domain)
      and the result is always a natural number
      (an element of the codomain).
      Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output
      (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.).
      The set of natural numbers that
      <em>are</em> outputs is called the
      <term>range</term>
          <idx><h>range</h></idx>
      of the function
      (in this case,
      the range is <m>\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}</m>,
      all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).
    </p>
            <p permid="EYs">
      The key thing that makes a rule a <em>function</em>
      is that there is <em>exactly one</em> output for each input.
      That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule.
      What output do we assign to the input 7?
      There can only be one answer for any particular function.

            <title>Describing Functions</title>
            <p permid="JIl">
      It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description.
      The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it.
      But when we <em>do</em> want to talk about the function,
      we need a way to describe it.
      A particular function can be described in multiple ways.
    </p>
            <p permid="pPu">
      Some calculus textbooks talk about the <em>Rule of Four</em>,
      that every function can be described in four ways:
      algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically,
      or in words.
      In discrete math,
      we can still use any of these to describe functions,
      but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have <m>\N</m> or a finite subset of <m>\N</m> as their domain.
    </p>
            <p permid="VWD">
      Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function:
      plotting the points on the plain.
      We can do this,
      and might get a graph like the following for a function <m>f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}</m>.

      A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.

      This shows that the function <m>f</m> sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3:
      just follow the arrows.
    </p>
            <p permid="uzn">
      The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions.
      We will often be working with functions with
      <em>finite</em> domains,
      so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.
    </p>
            <p permid="aGw">
      Note that for finite domains,
      finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible.
      Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like
      <me permid="RWE">
        f(x) = \begin{cases} x+1 \amp \text{ if } x = 1 \\ x-1 \amp \text{ if } x = 2 \\ x \amp \text{ if } x = 3\end{cases}
      </me>.
      This describes exactly the same function as above,
      but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.
    </p>
            <p permid="GNF">
      Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains,
      let's adopt some notation to describe them.
      All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain.
      In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:

      To be a function,
      a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain.
      However, we have seen that the reverse
      <em>is</em> permissible:
      a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain.
      When this <em>does not</em> occur
      (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain)
      then we say the function is
      <term>one-to-one</term>.

      Again, this terminology makes sense:
      we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain.

            <p permid="hfC">
      When discussing functions,
      we have notation for talking about an element of the domain
      (say <m>x</m>)
      and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write <m>f(x)</m>,
      which <em>is</em> the image of <m>x</m>).
      Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain.
      It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain
      (say <m>y</m>)
      and talk about which element or elements
      (if any)
      from the domain it is the image of.
      We could write <q>those <m>x</m> in the domain such that <m>f(x) = y</m>,</q>
      but this is a lot of writing.
      Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
    </p>
            <p permid="NmL">
      To address the first situation,
      what we are after is a way to describe the <em>set</em>
      of images of elements in some subset of the domain.
      Suppose <m>f:X \to Y</m> is a function and that
      <m>A \subseteq X</m> is some subset of the domain
      (possibly all of it).
      We will use the notation <m>f(A)</m> to denote the
      <term>image of <m>A</m> under <m>f</m></term>,
      namely the set of elements in <m>Y</m> that are the image of elements from <m>A</m>.
      That is, <m>f(A) = \{f(a) \in Y \st a \in A\}</m>.

      <notation><usage>f(A)</usage><description>the image of <m>A</m> under <m>f</m>.</description></notation>

    </p>
            <p permid="ttU">
      We can do this in the other direction as well.
      We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain.
      Let <m>f:X \to Y</m> be a function and suppose
      <m>B \subseteq Y</m> is a subset of the codomain.
      Then we will write <m>f\inv(B)</m> for the
      <term>inverse image of <m>B</m> under <m>f</m></term>,
      namely the set of elements in <m>X</m> whose image are elements in <m>B</m>.
      In other words, <m>f\inv(B) = \{x \in X \st f(x) \in B\}</m>.

      <notation><usage>f\inv(B)</usage><description>the inverse image of <m>B</m> under <m>f</m>.</description></notation>

    </p>
            <p permid="ZBd">
      Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element <m>y</m> of in the codomain.
      The notation above works:
      <m>f\inv(\{y\})</m> is the set of all elements in the domain that <m>f</m> sends to <m>y</m>.
      It makes sense to think of this as a set:
      there might not be anything sent to <m>y</m>
      (if <m>y</m> is not in the range),
      in which case <m>f\inv(\{y\}) = \emptyset</m>.
      Or <m>f</m> might send multiple elements to <m>y</m>
      (if <m>f</m> is not injective).
      As a notational convenience,
      we usually drop the set braces around the <m>y</m> and write
      <m>f\inf(y)</m> instead for this set.
    </p>
            <p permid="FIm">
      WARNING: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is not an inverse function!
      Inverse functions only exist for bijections,
      but <m>f\inv(y)</m> is defined for any function <m>f</m>.
      The point: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is a <em>set</em>,
      not an <em>element</em> of the domain.
      This is just sloppy notation for <m>f\inv(\{y\})</m>.
      To help make this distinction,
      we would call <m>f\inv(y)</m> the
      <term>complete inverse image of <m>y</m> under <m>f</m></term>.
      It is not the image of <m>y</m> under <m>f\inv</m>

      BEGIN_PGML
      Consider the function [`f:\{1,2,3,4\} \to \{1,2,3,4\}`] given by
      
      [```\newcommand{\twoline}[2]{\begin{pmatrix}#1 \\ #2 \end{pmatrix}}\newcommand{\amp}{&amp;}
                    f(n) = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{4 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 4}

      a.  Find an element of the codomain that is not in the range.

      BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
      a.  [`f(1) = 4\text{,}`] since [`4`] is the number below 1 in the two-line notation.
      
      a.  Such an [`n`] is [`n= 2\text{,}`] since [`f(2) = 1\text{.}`] Note that 2 is above a 1 in the notation.
      
      a.  [`n = 4`] has this property. We say that 4 is a fixed point of [`f\text{.}`] Not all functions have such a point.
      
      a.  Such an element is 2 (in fact, that is the only element in the codomain that is not in the range). In other words, 2 is not the image of any element under [`f\text{;}`] nothing is sent to 2.

      </li><li>
      <p>This is a bijection. Every element in the codomain is the image of <em>exactly</em> one element of the domain.</p>
      </li><li>
      <p>This is a bijection. Note that we can write this function in two line notation as <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{5 \amp 4 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 1}\text{.}</m></p>
      </li><li>
      <p>In two line notation, this function is <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{1 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp 3}\text{.}</m> From this we can quickly see it is neither injective (for example, 1 is the image of both 1 and 2) nor surjective (for example, 4 is not the image of anything).</p>

      a.  This is neither injective nor surjective. It is not injective because more than one element from the domain has 3 as its image. It is not surjective because there are elements of the codomain (1, 2, 4, and 5) that are not images of anything from the domain.
      
      a.  This is a bijection. Every element in the codomain is the image of _exactly_ one element of the domain.
      
      a.  This is a bijection. Note that we can write this function in two line notation as [`\newcommand{\twoline}[2]{\begin{pmatrix}#1 \\ #2 \end{pmatrix}}\newcommand{\amp}{&amp;}f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{5 \amp 4 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 1}\text{.}`]
      
      a.  In two line notation, this function is [`\newcommand{\twoline}[2]{\begin{pmatrix}#1 \\ #2 \end{pmatrix}}\newcommand{\amp}{&amp;}f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{1 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp 3}\text{.}`] From this we can quickly see it is neither injective (for example, 1 is the image of both 1 and 2) nor surjective (for example, 4 is not the image of anything).

        </me>.
        Note that with the initial condition <m>f(0) = 1</m>,
        the values of the function are:
        <m>f(1) = 4</m>, <m>f(2) = 2</m>,
        <m>f(3) = 1</m>, <m>f(4) = 4</m>,
        and so on, the images cycling through those three numbers.
        Thus <m>f</m> is NOT injective
        (and also certainly not surjective).
        Might it be under other initial conditions?<fn>
        It turns out this is a <em>really</em>
        hard question to answer in general.
        The <em>Collatz conjecture</em>
        is that no matter what the initial condition is,
        the function will eventually produce 1 as an output.
        This is an open problem in mathematics:
        nobody knows the answer.

              To prove this,
              we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain.
              Since <m>f(\{1\}) = 1</m> and <m>f(\{2\}) = 1</m>,
              we see that <m>f</m> is not injective.

      Let [`\newcommand{\s}[1]{\mathscr #1}X = \{n \in \N \st 0 \le n \le 999\}`] be the set of all numbers with three or fewer digits. Define the function [`f:X \to \N`] by [`f(abc) = a+b+c\text{,}`] where [`a\text{,}`] [`b\text{,}`] and [`c`] are the digits of the number in [`X`] (write numbers less than 100 with leading 0's to make them three digits).

                Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>.
                Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
                If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even,
                then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>.
                Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>,
                we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>.
                Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd,
                then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>.
                The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd
                (or visa-versa).
                But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even,
                so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
                Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>,
                which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

                Let <m>y</m> be an element of the codomain <m>\Z</m>.
                We will show there is an element <m>n</m> of the domain (<m>\Z</m>) such that <m>f(n) = y</m>.
                There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>.
                Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd,
                so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired.
                Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>.
                Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even,
                so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as needed.

      and <q>if spiders have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp</q> are exactly the same.

      True or false?
      We will answer this question,
      and won't need to know anything about Monopoly.
      Instead we will look at the logical
      <em>form</em> of the statement.
    </p>
            <p permid="FXh">
      We need to decide when the statement <m>(P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)</m> is true.
      Using the definitions of the connectives in
      <xref ref="sec_background-statements"/>, we see that for this to be true,
      either <m>P \imp Q</m> must be true or <m>Q \imp R</m> must be true
      (or both).
      Those are true if either <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m> is true
      (in the first case)
      and <m>Q</m> is false or <m>R</m> is true
      (in the second case).
      So<mdash/>yeah, it gets kind of messy.
      Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities.
      Enter <term>truth tables</term>.
      The idea is this: on each row,
      we list a possible combination of T's and F's
      (for true and false)
      for each of the sentential variables,
      and then mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case.
      We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's.
      Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false.
      For complicated statements,
      we will first fill in values for each part of the statement,
      as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    </p>
            <p permid="meq">
      Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected,
      all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives.
      Here they are:

      Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful.
      Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into what it is saying,
      or how to prove or refute it.
      By using truth tables we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.

      This is just the truth table for <m>P \imp Q</m>,
      but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table.
      Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true.
      The premises in this case are <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>P</m>.
      Which <em>rows</em> of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? <m>P</m> is true in the first two rows,
      and of those,
      only the first row has <m>P \imp Q</m> true as well.
      And lo-and-behold, in this one case, <m>Q</m> is also true.
      So if <m>P\imp Q</m> and <m>P</m> are both true,
      we see that <m>Q</m> must be true as well.

      As we saw in <xref ref="sec_background-statements"/>,
      not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone.
      For example, we might want to work with the statement:
    </p>
            <blockquote permid="GsG">
              <p permid="Wly">
        All primes greater than 2 are odd.
      </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p permid="kYX">
      To write this statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers.
      We can translate as follows:
      <me permid="usJ">
        \forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x))
      </me>.
      In this case, we are using <m>P(x)</m> to denote
      <q><m>x</m> is prime</q>
      and <m>O(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is odd.</q>
      These are not propositions,
      since their truth value depends on the input <m>x</m>.
      Better to think of <m>P</m> and <m>O</m> as denoting
      <em>properties</em> of their input.
      The technical term for these is <term>predicates</term>
      and when we study them in logic,
      we need to use <term>predicate logic</term>.
    </p>
            <p permid="Rgg">
      It is important to stress that predicate logic
      <em>extends</em> propositional logic
      (much in the way quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics).
      You will notice that our statement above still used the (propositional) logical connectives.
      Everything that we learned about logical equivalence and deductions still applies.
      However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution,
      digging down into the individual propositions <m>P</m>,
      <m>Q</m>, etc.
    </p>
            <p permid="xnp">
      A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text.
      One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here).
      Rather, we end with a two examples of logical equivalence and deduction,
      to pique your interest.
    </p>
            <example permid="MhS">
              <statement>
                <p permid="fFk">
          Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number.
          We can translate this into symbols as
          <me permid="azS">
            \neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
          </me>
          (literally, <q>it is not true that there is a number <m>x</m> such that for all numbers <m>y</m>,
          <m>x</m> is less than or equal to <m>y</m></q>).
        </p>
                <p permid="LMt">
          However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers:
          we can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type
          (between universal and existential).
          So the statement above should be
          <em>logically equivalent</em> to
          <me permid="GHb">
            \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
          </me>.
          Notice that <m>y \lt x</m> is the negation of <m>x \le y</m>.
          This literally says,
          <q>for every number <m>x</m> there is a number <m>y</m> which is smaller than <m>x</m>.</q>
          We see that this is another way to make our original claim.
        </p>
              </statement>
            </example>
            <example permid="spb">
              <statement>
                <p permid="rTC">
          Can you switch the order of quantifiers?
          For example, consider the two statements:
          <me permid="mOk">
            \forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y)
          </me>.
          Are these logically equivalent?
        </p>
              </statement>
              <solution permid="hPW">
                <p permid="Zge">
          These statements are NOT logically equivalent.
          To see this,
          we should provide an interpretation of the predicate <m>P(x,y)</m> which makes one of the statements true and the other false.
        </p>
                <p permid="Fnn">
          Let <m>P(x,y)</m> be the predicate <m>x \lt y</m>.
          It is true, in the natural numbers,
          that for all <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> greater than that <m>x</m>
          (since there are infinitely many numbers).
          However, there is not a natural number <m>y</m> which is greater than every number <m>x</m>.
          Thus it is possible for <m>\forall x \exists y P(x,y)</m> to be true while <m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m> is false.
        </p>
                <p permid="luw">
          We cannot do the reverse of this though.
          If there is some <m>y</m> for which every <m>x</m> satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>,
          then certainly for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> which satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>.
          The first is saying we can find one <m>y</m> that works for every <m>x</m>.
          The second allows different <m>y</m>'s to work for different <m>x</m>'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same <m>y</m> that work for every <m>x</m>.
          In other words,
          while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements,
          we do have a valid deduction rule:

          Put yet another way, this says that the single statement

          This is sort of like a tautology,
          although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic.

      Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs.
      Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging.
      There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs.
      For example, in the summer of 1742,
      a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes.
      Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact
      (computers have checked that <q>Goldbach's Conjecture</q>
      holds for all numbers less than <m>4\times 10^{18}</m>,
      which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).

      Writing proofs is a bit of an art.
      Like any art, to be truly great at it,
      you need some sort of inspiration,
      as well as some foundational technique.
      Just as musicians can learn proper fingering,
      and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush,
      we can look at the proper way to construct arguments.
      A good place to start might be to study a classic.

      The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on.
      Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook,
      you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true.
      Additionally,
      it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof.
      This is where using tools from logic is helpful.
      Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again.
      Being familiar with these can help understand proof,
      as well as give ideas of how to write your own.

      It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example.
      Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example.
      This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of <u>all</u> integers.
      We claim that <m>n^2</m> being even implies that <m>n</m> is even,
      <em>no matter what integer</em> <m>n</m> we pick.

      So far we have gotten only primes.
      You might be tempted to conjecture,
      <q>For all positive integers <m>n</m>,
      the number <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is prime.</q>
      If you wanted to prove this,
      you would need to use a direct proof,
      a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof,
      but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples.
      In fact, we can prove this conjecture is
      <em>false</em> by proving its negation:
      <q>There is a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is not prime.</q>
      Since this is an existential statement,
      it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.
    </p>
            <p permid="Rnk">
      In fact, we can quickly see that <m>n = 41</m> will give <m>41^2</m> which is certainly not prime.
      You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is always prime.
      Since so many statements in mathematics are universal,
      making their negations existential,
      we can often prove that a statement is false
      (if it is)
      by providing a counterexample.

          then <m>a + b</m> is odd.</q> This is false!
          How do we prove it is false?
          We need to prove the negation of the converse.
          Let's look at the symbols.
          The converse is
          <me permid="OsE">
            \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))
          </me>.
        </p>
                <p permid="OOd">
          We want to prove the negation:
          <me permid="uzN">
            \neg \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))
          </me>.
        </p>
                <p permid="uVm">
          Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:
          <me permid="aGW">
            \exists a \exists b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \wedge \neg O(a+b))
          </me>.
        </p>
                <p permid="bcv">
          As the negation passed by the quantifiers,
          they changed from <m>\forall</m> to <m>\exists</m>.
          We then needed to take the negation of an implication,
          which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.
        </p>
                <p permid="HjE">
          Now we know what to do.
          To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that <m>a</m> is odd or <m>b</m> is odd,
          but <m>a+b</m> is not odd
          (so even).
          That's easy: 1 and 3.
          (remember, <q>or</q> means one or the other or both).
          Both of these are odd, but <m>1+3 = 4</m> is not odd.

      We could go on and on and on about different proof styles
      (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here),
      but instead we will end with one final useful technique:
      proof by cases.
      The idea is to prove that <m>P</m> is true by proving that <m>Q \imp P</m> and
      <m>\neg Q \imp P</m> for some statement <m>Q</m>.
      So no matter what, whether or not <m>Q</m> is true,
      we know that <m>P</m> is true.
      In fact, we could generalize this.
      Suppose we want to prove <m>P</m>.
      We know that at least one of the statements <m>Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n</m> is true.
      If we can show that <m>Q_1 \imp P</m> and
      <m>Q_2 \imp P</m> and so on all the way to <m>Q_n \imp P</m>,
      then we can conclude <m>P</m>.
      The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases
      (the <m>Q_i</m>'s)
      must be true no matter what.

      Mathematical induction is a proof technique,
      not unlike direct proof or proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof. 
      In other words,
      induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true.
      Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what they mean.
      Others are very difficult to prove<mdash/>in fact,
      there are relatively simple mathematical statements which nobody yet knows how to prove.
      To facilitate the discovery of proofs,
      it is important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments.
      Induction is one such style.
      Let's start with an example:
    </p>
          </introduction>
          <subsection xml:id="subsec_induction-stamps" permid="vyp">
            <title>Stamps</title>
            <investigation permid="MwA">
              <p permid="Xka">
        You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need.
        You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps.
        Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps?
        Which amounts are impossible to make?
      </p>
            </investigation>
            <p permid="Upu">
      Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage,
      and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.
      Perhaps you did this in order:
      can you make 1 cent of postage?
      Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents?
      And so on.
      If this is what you did,
      you were actually answering a <em>sequence</em> of questions.
      We have methods for dealing with sequences.
      Let's see if that helps.
    </p>
            <p permid="AwD">
      Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions,
      but rather a sequence of statements.
      Let <m>P(n)</m>
  
      <notation><usage>P(n)</usage><description>the <m>n</m>th case we are trying to prove by induction</description></notation>
  
      be the statement <q>you can make <m>n</m> cents of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.</q>
      Since for each value of <m>n</m>,
      <m>P(n)</m> is a statement, it is either true or false.
      So if we form the sequence of statements
      <me permid="Bgx">
        P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), \ldots
      </me>,
      the sequence will consist of <m>T</m>'s
      (for true)
      and <m>F</m>'s
      (for false).
      In our particular case the sequence starts
      <me permid="hnG">
        F,F,F,F,T,F,F,T,F,T,F,F,T,\ldots
      </me>
      because <m>P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4)</m> are all false
      (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents of postage)
      but <m>P(5)</m> is true
      (use one 5-cent stamp),
      and so on.
    </p>
            <p permid="gDM">
      Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of <m>P(n)</m> for some specific <m>n</m>
      (the <q>value</q> will be either <m>T</m> or <m>F</m>).
      How did we find the value of the <m>n</m>th term of a sequence of numbers?
      How did we find <m>a_n</m>?
      There were two ways we could do this:
      either there was a closed formula for <m>a_n</m>,
      so we could plug in <m>n</m> into the formula and get our output value,
      or we had a recursive definition for the sequence,
      so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the <m>n</m>th term.
      When dealing with sequences of statements,
      we could use either of these techniques as well.
      Maybe there is a way to use <m>n</m> itself to determine whether we can make <m>n</m> cents of postage.
      That would be something like a closed formula.
      Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence
      (of statements)
      to determine whether we can make <m>n</m> cents of postage.
      That is, if we know the value of <m>P(n-1)</m>, can we get from that to
      the value of <m>P(n)</m>?
      That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence.
      Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas.
      The same is true here.
    </p>
            <p permid="MKV">
      Suppose I told you that <m>P(43)</m> was true
      (it is).
      Can you determine from this fact the value of <m>P(44)</m> (whether it true or false)?
      Yes you can.
      Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps,
      we do know that there was some way to do it.
      What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)?
      We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps
      (making 16 cents).
      The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents,
      so <m>P(44)</m> is true.
      Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent stamps.
      What if we didn't?
      Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps
      (making 24 cents).
      If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents,
      so <m>P(44)</m> is true.
    </p>
            <p permid="sSe">
      Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents,
      just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents.
      How do we know we can make 43 cents?
      Perhaps because we know we can make <m>42</m>
  
      <notation><usage>42</usage><description>the ultimate answer to life, etc.</description></notation>
  
      cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents,
      and so on.
      It's a recursion!
      As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence,
      we must specify our initial value.
      In this case, the initial value is
      <q><m>P(1)</m> is false.</q> That's not good,
      since our recurrence relation just says that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true <em>if</em>
      <m>P(k)</m> is also true.
      We need to start the process with a true <m>P(k)</m>.
      So instead, we might want to use
      <q><m>P(28)</m> is true</q>
      as the initial condition.
    </p>
            <p permid="YZn">
      Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact:
      it is possible to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.<fn>
      This is not claiming that there are no amounts less than 27 cents which can also be made.
      </fn> In other words, <m>P(k)</m> is true for any <m>k \ge 28</m>.
      To prove this, we could do the following:
  
      <ol permid="Lrh"><li permid="ryq">
          <p permid="cps">
            Demonstrate that <m>P(28)</m> is true.
          </p>
        </li><li permid="XFz">
          <p permid="IwB">
            Prove that if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
            then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true
            (for any <m>k \ge 28</m>).
          </p>
        </li></ol>
    </p>
            <p permid="Fgw">
      Suppose we have done this.
      Then we know that the 28th term of the sequence above is a <m>T</m>
      (using step 1, the initial condition or <term>base case</term>),
      and that every term after the 28th is <m>T</m> also
      (using step 2, the recursive part or
      <term>inductive case</term>).
      Here is what the proof would actually look like.
    </p>
            <proof permid="GHo">
              <p permid="cZm">
        Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement
        <q>it is possible to make exactly <m>n</m> cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.</q>
        We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 28</m>.
      </p>
              <p permid="Jgv">
        First, we show that <m>P(28)</m> is true:
        <m>28 = 4 \cdot 5+ 1\cdot 8</m>,
        so we can make <m>28</m> cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.
      </p>
              <p permid="pnE">
        Now suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 28</m>.
        Then it is possible to make <m>k</m> cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.
        Note that since <m>k \ge 28</m>,
        it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps <em>and</em>
        fewer than three 8-cent stamps:
        using two of each would give only 26 cents.
        Now if we have made <m>k</m> cents using at least three 5-cent stamps,
        replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps.
        This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents,
        moving from a total of <m>k</m> cents to <m>k+1</m> cents.
        Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
        On the other hand,
        if we have made <m>k</m> cents using at least three 8-cent stamps,
        then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps,
        moving from 24 cents to 25 cents,
        giving a total of <m>k+1</m> cents of postage.
        So in this case as well <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
      </p>
              <p permid="VuN">
        Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
        <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 28</m>.
      </p>
            </proof>

            <title>Formalizing Proofs</title>
            <p permid="lnF">
      What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems.
      Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers,
      or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above),
      and in some other situations too.
      In particular,
      induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next <ndash/> when you can see how to always <q>do one more.</q>
    </p>
            <p permid="RuO">
      This is a big idea.
      Thinking about a problem <em>inductively</em>
      can give new insight into the problem.
      For example, to really understand the stamp problem,
      you should think about how any amount of postage
      (greater than 28 cents)
      can be made
      (this is non-inductive reasoning)
      and also how the ways in which postage can be made
      <em>changes</em> as the amount increases
      (inductive reasoning).
      When you are asked to provide a proof by induction,
      you are being asked to think about the problem <em>dynamically</em>;
      how does increasing <m>n</m> change the problem?
    </p>
            <p permid="xBX">
      But there is another side to proofs by induction as well.
      In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem,
      you must also be able to communicate the problem to others.
      Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style,
      allowing mathematicians to share their ideas efficiently.
      Proofs by induction have a certain formal style,
      and being able to write in this style is important.
      It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.

        Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: <q>Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement<ellipsis/></q> To prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, you must prove two facts:
  
        <ol permid="zcP"><li permid="DMI">
            <p permid="oDK">
              Base case: Prove that <m>P(0)</m> is true.
              You do this directly.
              This is often easy.
            </p>
          </li><li permid="jTR">
            <p permid="UKT">
              Inductive case: Prove that
              <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for all <m>k \ge 0</m>.
              That is, prove that for any <m>k \ge 0</m> if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
              then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
              This is the proof of an if
              <ellipsis/> then
              <ellipsis/> statement,
              so you can assume <m>P(k)</m> is true (<m>P(k)</m> is called the
              <em>inductive hypothesis</em>).
                <idx><h>inductive hypothesis</h></idx>
            You must then explain why <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true, given that assumption.

      </p>

      (or the other value).
    </p>
            <p permid="pXy">
      The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid.
      Why does induction work?
      Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges.
      We want to argue that in a minute,
      all the dominoes will have fallen down.
      For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino.
      That is the base case.
      It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls,
      it will cause the next domino to fall.
      That is the inductive case.
      If both of these conditions are met,
      you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall,
      then all the dominoes will fall.
    </p>
            <p permid="WeH">
      Induction is powerful!
      Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself.
      You just start the chain reaction,
      and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.
    </p>
            <p permid="ClQ">
      Think about our study of sequences.
      It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas.
      Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case.
      That is what is so great about induction.
      Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for <m>n</m>,
      we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.
    </p>
            <p permid="isZ">
      When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction,
      you should first think about <em>why</em> the statement is true,
      using inductive reasoning.
      Explain why induction is the right thing to do,
      and roughly why the inductive case will work.
      Then, sit down and write out a careful,
      formal proof using the structure above.

          First, let's think inductively about this equation.
          In fact, we know this is true for other reasons
          (reverse and add comes to mind).
          But why might induction be applicable?
          The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to <m>n</m>.
          If we know how to do that,
          adding just one more term (<m>n+1</m>) would not be that hard.
          For example, if <m>n = 100</m>,
          suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is <m>5050</m>
          (so <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050</m>, which is true).
          Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers,
          it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050,
          instead of computing the entire sum again.
          We would have <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151</m>.
          In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term.
          This is why we should use induction.

            We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 1</m>.

                  <p permid="lJe">
            Inductive case: Let <m>k \ge 1</m> be a natural number.

            That means <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}</m>.
            We will prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
            That is, we must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}</m>.
            To prove this equation,
            start by adding <m>k+1</m> to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:
            <me permid="NuP">
              1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)

      Seeing how to use the inductive hypotheses is usually straight forward when proving a fact about a sum like this.
      In other proofs, it can be less obvious where it fits in.

          Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem.
          What does increasing <m>n</m> do?
          Let's try with a few examples.
          If <m>n = 1</m>, then yes, <m>6^1 - 1 = 5</m> is a multiple of 5.
          What does incrementing <m>n</m> to 2 look like?
          We get <m>6^2 - 1 = 35</m>, which again is a multiple of 5.
          Next, <m>n = 3</m>: but instead of just finding <m>6^3 - 1</m>,
          what did the increase in <m>n</m> do?
          We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first.
          Viewed another way,
          we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6
          (because <m>6^2 - 1</m> is a multiple of 5, so <m>6^2</m> is one more than a multiple of 5).
          What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like?
          They must have last digit 1 or 6.
          What happens when you multiply such a number by 6?
          Depends on the number, but in any case,
          the last digit of the new number must be a 6.
          And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.
        </p>
                <p permid="KlO">
          The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six,
          we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5.

            Inductive case: Let <m>k</m> be an arbitrary natural number.
            Assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
            That is, <m>6^k - 1</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>.
            Then <m>6^k - 1 = 5j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>.
            This means that <m>6^k = 5j + 1</m>.
            Multiply both sides by <m>6</m>:
            <me permid="tBY">
              6^{k+1} = 6(5j+1) = 30j + 6

          </p>
                  <p permid="iOy">
            But we want to know about <m>6^{k+1} - 1</m>,
            so subtract 1 from both sides:

              6^{k+1} - 1 = 30j + 5

            Therefore <m>6^{k+1} - 1</m> is a multiple of 5, or in other words,

          First, the idea of the argument.
          What happens when we increase <m>n</m> by 1?
          On the left-hand side,
          we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number.
          On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2.
          This means we double the number.
          So the question is,
          how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square?
          Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like.
          We have <m>(n+1)^2 - n^2</m>.
          This factors:
          <me permid="FQq">
            (n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1
          </me>.
        </p>
                <p permid="Hri">
          But doubling the right-hand side increases it by <m>2^n</m>,
          since <m>2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n</m>.
          When <m>n</m> is large enough, <m>2^n &gt; 2n + 1</m>.
        </p>
                <p permid="nyr">
          What we are saying here is that each time <m>n</m> increases,
          the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side.
          So if the left-hand side starts smaller
          (as it does when <m>n = 5</m>),
          it will never catch up.
          Now the formal proof:

                <proof permid="OlN">
                  <p permid="TFA">

            Base case: <m>P(5)</m> is the statement <m>5^2 \lt 2^5</m>.
            Since <m>5^2 = 25</m> and <m>2^5 = 32</m>,

            Inductive case: Let <m>k \ge 5</m> be an arbitrary integer.

            That is, assume <m>k^2 \lt  2^k</m>.
            We will prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
            i.e., <m>(k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}</m>.
            To prove such an inequality,
            start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:

            Following the equalities and inequalities through,

            in other words, <m>P(k+1)</m>.
            Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
            <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 5</m>.

            <p permid="ncS">
      The previous example might remind you of the

      a</m>, then <m>f(x) \lt g(x)</m> for <m>x &gt; a</m>.
      Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a faster rate than the smaller function,
      so the larger function will stay larger.
      In discrete math, we don't have derivatives,
      so we look at differences.
      Thus induction is the way to go.

          Given a <m>n</m>-square rectangular chocolate bar,

      It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar once,
      you are left with <em>smaller</em> chocolate bars.
      Reducing to smaller cases is what induction is all about.
      We can inductively assume we already know how to deal with these smaller bars.
      The problem is,
      if we are trying to prove the inductive case about a <m>(k+1)</m>-square bar,
      we don't know that after the first break the remaining bar will have <m>k</m> squares.
      So we really need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than <m>k+1</m>.
    </p>
            <p permid="Ebd">
      Is it valid to make this stronger assumption?
      Remember, in induction we are attempting to prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m>.
      What if that were not the case?
      Then there would be some first <m>n_0</m> for which <m>P(n_0)</m> was false.
      Since <m>n_0</m> is the <em>first</em> counterexample,
      we know that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \lt n_0</m>.
      Now we proceed to prove that <m>P(n_0)</m> is actually true,
      based on the assumption that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all smaller <m>n</m>.
    </p>
            <p permid="kim">
      This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis.
      We can assume that <m>P(1)</m>, <m>P(2)</m>, <m>P(3)</m>,
      <ellipsis/> <m>P(k)</m> is true,
      just to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
      Previously, we just assumed <m>P(k)</m> for this purpose.
    </p>
            <p permid="Qpv">
      It is slightly easier if we change our variables for strong induction.
      Here is what the formal proof would look like:

        Inductive case:

        Break the bar once along any row or column.

        That is, we have an <m>a</m>-square rectangular chocolate bar,

        Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares.

      Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the statement you want to prove.
      If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction.
      It really is <em>stronger</em>,
      so can accomplish everything <q>weak</q> induction can.
      That said, using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the induction hypothesis.
      There is also something to be said for
      <em>elegance</em> in proofs.
      If you can prove a statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.

      As a final contrast between the two forms of induction,
      consider once more the stamp problem.
      Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent
      (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps,
      or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps).
      We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction.
      First, we could show <em>five</em> base cases:
      it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents
      (we would actually say how each of these is made).
      Now assume that it is possible to make <m>k</m> cents of postage for all <m>k \lt n</m> as long as <m>k \ge 28</m>.
      As long as <m>n &gt; 32</m>,
      this means in particular we can make <m>k = n-5</m> cents.
      Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make <m>n</m> cents.

          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
          First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>.
          We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true,
          so <m>P(1)</m> is established.
          Now the inductive case.
          Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
          That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>.
          We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>).
          We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:

        we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum.

        <p>Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</p>
        <p>Copyright <copyright/> 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<url href="http://www.fsf.org/"/>&gt;</p>
        <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section0">
          <title>0. PREAMBLE</title>
          <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document <q>free</q> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>
          <p>This License is a kind of <q>copyleft</q>, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>
          <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section1">
          <title>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>
          <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The <q>Document</q>, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as <q>you</q>. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.</p>
          <p>A <q>Modified Version</q> of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
          <p>A <q>Secondary Section</q> is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p>
          <p>The <q>Invariant Sections</q> are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>
          <p>The <q>Cover Texts</q> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>
          <p>A <q>Transparent</q> copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <q>Transparent</q> is called <q>Opaque</q>.</p>
          <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p>
          <p>The <q>Title Page</q> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, <q>Title Page</q> means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>
          <p>The <q>publisher</q> means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p>
          <p>A section <q>Entitled XYZ</q> means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as <q>Acknowledgements</q>, <q>Dedications</q>, <q>Endorsements</q>, or <q>History</q>.) To <q>Preserve the Title</q> of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section <q>Entitled XYZ</q> according to this definition.</p>
          <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section2">
          <title>2. VERBATIM COPYING</title>
          <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
          <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section3">
          <title>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>
          <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>
          <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p>
          <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</p>
          <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section4">
          <title>4. MODIFICATIONS</title>
          <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:<ol label="A."><li><p>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</p></li><li><p>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.</p></li><li><p>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.</p></li><li><p>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li><p>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.</p></li><li><p>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li><p>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li><p>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p></li><li><p>Preserve the section Entitled <q>History</q>, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled <q>History</q> in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li><p>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the <q>History</q> section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p></li><li><p>For any section Entitled <q>Acknowledgements</q> or <q>Dedications</q>, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</p></li><li><p>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</p></li><li><p>Delete any section Entitled <q>Endorsements</q>. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.</p></li><li><p>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled <q>Endorsements</q> or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p></li><li><p>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</p></li></ol></p>
          <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
          <p>You may add a section Entitled <q>Endorsements</q>, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties <mdash/> for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>
          <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
          <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section5">
          <title>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>
          <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>
          <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
          <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled <q>History</q> in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled <q>History</q>; likewise combine any sections Entitled <q>Acknowledgements</q>, and any sections Entitled <q>Dedications</q>. You must delete all sections Entitled <q>Endorsements</q>.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section6">
          <title>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>
          <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
          <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section7">
          <title>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
          <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an <q>aggregate</q> if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>
          <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section8">
          <title>8. TRANSLATION</title>
          <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p>
          <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled <q>Acknowledgements</q>, <q>Dedications</q>, or <q>History</q>, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section9">
          <title>9. TERMINATION</title>
          <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>
          <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
          <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
          <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section10">
          <title>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>
          <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See <url href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/"/>.</p>
          <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License <q>or any later version</q> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="gfdl-section11">
          <title>11. RELICENSING</title>
          <p><q>Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site</q> (or <q>MMC Site</q>) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A <q>Massive Multiauthor Collaboration</q> (or <q>MMC</q>) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>
          <p><q>CC-BY-SA</q> means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p>
          <p><q>Incorporate</q> means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.</p>
          <p>An MMC is <q>eligible for relicensing</q> if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>
          <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>
