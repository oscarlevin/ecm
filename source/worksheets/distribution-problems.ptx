        <p>
          Provide a counting formula (such as <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>) and a counting model (such as <q><m>k</m>-elements subsets of <m>[n]</m></q>) that enumerate the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> items to <m>n</m> recipients under the given conditions.  Mark those that we do not know how to handle yet.
