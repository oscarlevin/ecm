    <introduction>
      <p>
        Please resist the urge to look at a hint right away.  Try to complete the activity or exercise and only look at the hint for verification or if you are really stuck.

      <p>
        A technical note: if you are using the pdf version, you can click on the title of the hint to link back to the original activity/exercise.  Those activities/exercises that have hints will display a link [hint] that will take you to the hint.
