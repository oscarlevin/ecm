          <m>a_n = 3 + 2^{n+1}</m>.  We should use telescoping or iteration here.  For example, telescoping gives

          We claim <m>a_n = 4^n</m> works. Plug it in: <m>4^n = 3(4^{n-1}) + 4(4^{n-2})</m>. This works - just simplify the right-hand side.

          We have characteristic polynomial <m>x^2 - 2x + 1</m>, which has <m>x = 1</m> as the only repeated root.  Thus using the characteristic root technique for repeated roots, the general solution is <m>a_n = a + bn</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> depend on the initial conditions.
