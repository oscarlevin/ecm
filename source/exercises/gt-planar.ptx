<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Is it possible for a planar graph to have 6 vertices, 10 edges and 5 faces? Explain.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
No. A (connected) planar graph must satisfy Euler's formula: <m>v - e + f = 2</m>. Here <m>v - e + f = 6 - 10 + 5 = 1</m>.

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
The graph <m>G</m> has 6 vertices with degrees <m>2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5</m>. How many edges does <m>G</m> have? Could <m>G</m> be planar? If so, how many faces would it have.  If not, explain.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
<m>G</m> has 10 edges, since <m>10 = \frac{2+2+3+4+4+5}{2}</m>. It could be planar, and then it would have 6 faces, using Euler's formula: <m>6-10+f = 2</m> means <m>f = 6</m>.  To make sure that it is actually planar though, we would need to draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing.  This can be done by trial and error (and is possible).

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Prove Euler's formula using induction on the number of edges in the graph.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement, <q>every planar graph containing <m>n</m> edges satisfies <m>v - n + f = 2</m>.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

			Base case: there is only one graph with zero edges, namely a single isolated vertex. In this case <m>v = 1</m>, <m>f = 1</m> and <m>e = 0</m>, so Euler's formula holds.

			Inductive case: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 0</m>. Now consider an arbitrary graph containing <m>k+1</m> edges (and <m>v</m> vertices and <m>f</m> faces). No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge to get a graph with <m>k</m> edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis to. There are two possibilities. First, the edge we remove might be incident to a degree 1 vertex. In this case, also remove that vertex. The smaller graph will now satisfy <m>v-1 - k + f = 2</m> by the induction hypothesis (removing the edge and vertex did not reduce the number of faces). Adding the edge and vertex back gives <m>v - (k+1) + f = 2</m>, as required. The second case is that the edge we remove is incident to vertices of degree greater than one. In this case, removing the edge will keep the number of vertices the same but reduce the number of faces by one. So by the inductive hypothesis we will have <m>v - k + f-1 = 2</m>. Adding the edge back will give <m>v - (k+1) + f = 2</m> as needed.

			Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, Euler's formula holds for all planar graphs.
