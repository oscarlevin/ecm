<statement>
<p>
What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of <m>K_{4,5}</m>? That is, find the chromatic number of the graph.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
2, since the graph is bipartite. One color for the top set of vertices, another color for the bottom set of vertices.
</p>
</solution>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Draw a graph with chromatic number 6 (i.e., which requires 6 colors to properly color the vertices). Could your graph be planar? Explain.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
For example, <m>K_6</m>. If the chromatic number is 6, then the graph is not planar; the 4-color theorem states that all planar graphs can be colored with 4 or fewer colors.

			A group of 10 friends decides to head up to a cabin in the woods (where nothing could possibly go wrong). Unfortunately, a number of these friends have dated each other in the past, and things are still a little awkward. To get the cabin, they need to divide up into some number of cars, and no two people who dated should be in the same car.
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					What is the smallest number of cars you need if all the relationships were strictly heterosexual? Represent an example of such a situation with a graph. What kind of graph do you get?

					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							2 cars are needed. Since no boys dated boys and no girls dated girls, it is possible to separate the youths into cars by gender. The corresponding graph (with vertices representing people and edges representing the fact that those people dated) would be bipartite - there are no edges between two boys and no edges between two girls.
				</p>
					</solution> -->
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Because a number of these friends dated there are also conflicts between friends of the same gender, listed below. Now what is the smallest number of conflict-free cars they could take to the cabin?

					<!-- <solution>

							Draw the graph where vertices represent the 10 people and edges representing conflicts. Color the graph properly. The chromatic number of the graph is 3 (and you know it can't be smaller because there is an odd cycle present in the graph).
						</p>
					</solution> -->
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					What do these questions have to do with coloring?

					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							We are really asking for the chromatic number of the graphs. The smallest number of cars needed is the smallest number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.

What is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of a cube so that no two adjacent vertices are colored identically?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
The cube can be represented as a planar graph and colored with two colors as follows:
</p>
<sidebyside width="20%">
	<image>
	<latex-image>\begin{tikzpicture}
			\foreach \ang in {45, 135, 225, 315} {
			\draw (\ang:.4) \v -- (\ang:1) \v -- (\ang+90:1) (\ang:.4) -- (\ang+90:.4);
			}
			\draw (45:.4) node[right]{\footnotesize R} (135:.4) node[left]{\footnotesize B} (225:.4) node[left]{\footnotesize R} (315:.4) node[right]{\footnotesize B} (45:1) node[right]{\footnotesize B} (135:1) node[left]{\footnotesize R} (225:1) node[left]{\footnotesize B} (315:1) node[right]{\footnotesize R};
			\end{tikzpicture}</latex-image>
	</image>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Since it would be impossible to color the vertices with a single color, we see that the cube has chromatic number 2 (it is bipartite).

					The chromatic number of <m>C_n</m> is two when <m>n</m> is even. What goes wrong when <m>n</m> is odd?
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Prove that your procedure from part (a) always works for any tree.

					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							You can always color the first vertex blue. None of the neighbors of this vertex could be neighbors with each other, for this would create a cycle. So all the neighbors can be colored red. Now all the (uncolored) neighbors of the red vertices can be colored blue <ndash /> the only way this would fail is if one was already adjacent to the first vertex (but this is impossible because we already colored all its neighbors) or adjacent to each other, but this would create a cycle. This continues at every step.

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Now, prove using induction that every tree has chromatic number 2.

					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							This proof is very similar to showing that every tree is a bipartite graph.
						</p>

						<proof>
							<p>
								Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>A tree with <m>n</m> vertices has a chromatic number of 2</q>
				</p>

							<p>
								Base Case: Consider a tree with <m>3</m> vertices. Since trees cannot have a cycle and two of the vertices are adjacent to the third vertex, we must have a coloring with 2 colors.
							</p>

							<p>
								Inductive Case: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k\lt n</m>. Now, I need to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. So, I can assume that I have a tree with <m>k+1</m> vertices and I must show that it has chromatic number 2. Now, if I remove one of leaf from the tree with <m>k+1</m> vertices I will be removing exactly 1 edge and 1 vertex. Therefore I have a tree with <m>k</m> vertices which I know by my inductive hypothesis must have a chromatic number of 2. Now, I can add that leaf back in, and since it's only attached to exactly one vertex which is colored one of the 2 colors, I can color the added vertex the opposite color and still have a chromatic number of 2. TBTPOMI <m>P(k+1)</m> is true for all <m>n\geq 3</m>.

			Prove the 6-color theorem: every planar graph has chromatic number 6 or less.  Do not assume the 4-color theorem (whose proof is MUCH harder), but you may assume the fact that every planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most 5.

Not all graphs are perfect. Give an example of a graph with chromatic number 4 that does not contain a copy of <m>K_4</m>. That is, there should be no 4 vertices all pairwise adjacent.

<p>
The wheel graph below has this property. The outside of the wheel forms an odd cycle, so requires 3 colors, the center of the wheel must be different than all the outside vertices.

Prove by induction on vertices that any graph <m>G</m> which contains at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> (the maximal degree of all vertices in <m>G</m>) has chromatic number at most <m>\Delta(G)</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<!-- <solution>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>G</m> be a graph with <m>n</m> vertices, maximal degree <m>\Delta(G)</m> and at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m>. Assume for the sake of induction that all graphs <m>G'</m> with fewer than <m>n</m> vertices and a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m> have chromatic number less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>.

		Find a vertex of <m>G</m> with degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> and remove it. This forms a subgraph <m>G'</m> which has <m>n-1</m> vertices. Also, since we removed edges, we know that <m>\Delta(G') \le \Delta(G)</m>. If these maximal degrees are equal, then <m>G'</m> must also have a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>, since at least one of its vertices had one more edge in <m>G</m>. In this case, we can apply our inductive hypothesis to produce a coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors. If <m>\Delta(G') \lt  \Delta(G)</m>, then we also can easily find a proper coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors by starting with any vertex and coloring it and all of its neighbors differently, and then fanning out. Thus <m>G'</m> has a proper vertex coloring using just <m>\Delta(G)</m>-many colors.

		Now move back to <m>G</m>. Put the removed vertex back into the graph. Since it is adjacent to at most <m>\Delta(G) - 1</m> other vertices, there will be one of the <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors that is not present among its neighbors, which we could use to color the newly inserted vertex.

You have a set of magnetic alphabet letters (one of each of the 26 letters in the alphabet) that you need to put into boxes. For obvious reasons, you don't want to put two consecutive letters in the same box. What is the fewest number of boxes you need (assuming the boxes are able to hold as many letters as they need to)?
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex, and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet, we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2 (for example, <m>D</m> would be adjacent to both <m>C</m> and <m>E</m>). By Brooks' theorem, this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle. Thus only two boxes are needed.

Prove that if you color every edge of <m>K_6</m> either red or blue, you are guaranteed a monochromatic triangle (that is, an all red or an all blue triangle).
</p>
</statement>
<!-- <solution>

<proof>
<p>
Start with a single vertex of <m>K_6</m>, call it <m>v_0</m>. There are five edges incident to <m>v_0</m>, and by the pigeonhole principle, three of these must be colored identically. Without loss of generality, say these edges are <m>(v_0, v_1)</m>, <m>(v_0, v_2)</m> and <m>(v_0,v_3)</m>, and are colored red. Consider the edges <m>(v_1,v_2)</m>, <m>(v_2,v_3)</m>, and <m>(v_3, v_1)</m>. If any of these are colored red, we would have a monochromatic red triangle (it plus the two edges incident to <m>v_0</m>). If they are all colored blue, then we have a monochromatic blue triangle (those three edges). Either way, we are guaranteed to monochromatic triangle.
