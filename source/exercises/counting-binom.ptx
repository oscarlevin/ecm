        <statement>

            Let <m>A = \{1,2,3,\ldots,9\}</m>.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many subsets of <m>A</m> are there? That is, find <m>|\pow(A)|</m>. Explain.

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    There are <m>512</m> subsets. This is <m>2^9</m>, which makes sense because we are deciding yes or no on whether to include each element of <m>A</m> in the subset.
              </p>

                How many subsets of <m>A</m> contain exactly 5 elements? Explain.

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    Of the nine elements in <m>A</m>, we must choose five of them to be in the subset. So <m>{9 \choose 5} = 126</m>.

                How many subsets of <m>A</m> contain only even numbers? Explain.

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    For each of the 9 elements from <m>A</m>, we must decide yes or no on whether to include them in the subset. However, for the odd numbers, we only have one choice: no. So there are only 4 elements we have two choices for, so the answer is <m>2^4 = 16</m>. (Note, if you wish to exclude the empty set - it does not contain odd numbers, but no evens either - then you could subtract 1).

                    176. There are 64 strings that start with 101, and another 128 which end with 11 (we choose 1 or 0 for 7 bits, so <m>2^7</m>). However, we count the strings that start with 101 and end with 11 twice - there are <m>16</m> such strings (<m>2^4</m>). So using PIE, we have <m>64 + 128 - 16 = 176</m>

                    51. There are <m>{6 \choose 3} = 20</m> strings of weight 5 which start with 101, and another <m>{7 \choose 3} = 35</m> which end with 11. We have over counted again - there are weight 5 strings which both start with 101 and end with 11, in fact <m>{4 \choose 1} = 4</m> of them. So all together we have <m>20 + 35 - 4 = 51</m> strings.

            You break your piggy-bank to discover lots of pennies and nickels. You start arranging these in rows of 6 coins.
          <ol>
            <li> <p> You find yourself making rows containing an equal number of pennies and nickels.  For fun, you decide to lay out every possible such row.  How many coins will you need? </p> </li>
            <li> <p> How many coins would you need to make all possible rows of 6 coins (not necessarily with equal number of pennies and nickels)? </p> </li>
          </ol>

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li> <p> We can think of each row as a 6-bit string of weight 3 (since of the 6 coins, we require 3 to be pennies).  Thus there are <m>{6 \choose 3} = 20</m> rows possible.  Each row requires 6 coins, so if we want to make all the rows at the same time, we will need 120 coins (60 of each). </p> </li>
              <li> <p> Now there are <m>2^6 = 64</m> rows possible, which is also <m>{6 \choose 0} + {6\choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + {6 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 4} + {6 \choose 5} + {6 \choose 6}</m>, if you break them up into rows containing 0, 1, 2, etc. pennies.  Thus we need <m>6 \cdot 64 = 384</m> coins (192 of each). </p> </li>

        <solution>
          <p>
            To get an <m>x^{12}</m>, we must pick 12 of the 15 factors to contribute an <m>x</m>, leaving the other 3 to contribute a 2. There are <m>{15 \choose 12}</m> ways to select these 12 factors. So the term containing an <m>x^{12}</m> will be <m>{15 \choose 12}x^{12}2^{3}</m>. In other words, the coefficient of <m>x^{12}</m> is <m>{15\choose 12}2^3 = 3640</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Gridtown USA, besides having excellent donut shoppes, is known for its precisely laid out grid of streets and avenues. Streets run east-west, and avenues north-south, for the entire stretch of the town, never curving and never interrupted by parks or schools or the like.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suppose you live on the corner of 1st and 1st and work on the corner of 12th and 12th. Thus you must travel 22 blocks to get to work as quickly as possible.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many different routes can you take to work, assuming you want to get there as quickly as possible?

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    <m>{22 \choose 11}</m> since you must choose 11 of the 22 blocks to travel east.

                Now suppose you want to stop and get a donut on the way to work, from your favorite donut shoppe on the corner of 8th st and 10th ave. How many routes to work, via the donut shoppe, can you take (again, ensuring the shortest possible route)?

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    The donut shoppe is 16 blocks away, 7 one way, 9 the other. So to get from home to the donut shoppe, there are <m>{16 \choose 7}</m> routes (or equivalently, <m>{16 \choose 9}</m>). Then from the donut shopped to work, you need to travel 6 more blocks, 2 on way and 4 the other. So there are <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> (or <m>{6 \choose 4}</m>) routes from the donut shoppe to work.
              </p>

                  <p>
                    For each of the ways to the donut shoppe, there are so many ways to work, so the multiplicative principle says the total number of ways from home to work via the donut shoppe is
                    <me>
                      {16 \choose 7}{6 \choose 2}

              <p>
                Disaster Strikes Gridtown: there is a pothole on 4th avenue between 5th and 6th street. How many routes to work can you take avoiding that unsightly (and dangerous) stretch of road?

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    Routes to work that hit the pothole: <m>{7 \choose 3}1{14 \choose 8}</m>.
              </p>

                  <p>
                    There for the number of routes to work which <em>avoid</em> the pothole are
                    <me>
                      {22 \choose 11} - {7 \choose 3}{14 \choose 8}

            <li>
              <p>
                How many routes are there both avoiding the pothole and visiting the donut shoppe?

                <!-- <solution>
                  <p>
                    First compute the number of routes to the donut shoppe avoiding the pothole:
                    <me>
                      {16 \choose 7} - {7 \choose 3}{8 \choose 6}
                    </me>
              </p>

                  <p>
                    Then you still need to go to work from there. Thus the answer is:
                    <me>
                      \left({16 \choose 7} - {7 \choose 3}{8 \choose 6}\right){6 \choose 2}

        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose you are ordering a large pizza from <em>D.P.<nbsp/>Dough</em>. You want 3 distinct toppings, chosen from their list of 11 vegetarian toppings.
          <ol>
            <li> <p> How many choices do you have for your pizza? </p> </li>
            <li> <p> How many choices do you have for your pizza if you refuse to have pineapple as one of your toppings? </p> </li>
            <li> <p> How many choices do you have for your pizza if you <em>insist</em> on having pineapple as one of your toppings? </p> </li>
            <li> <p> How do the three questions above relate to each other? </p> </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        </statement>
        <!-- <solution>
          <ol>
            <li><m>{11 \choose 3} = 165</m> choices, since you have to select a 3-element subset of the set of 11 toppings.</li>
            <li><m>{10 \choose 3} = 120</m> choices, since you must select 3 of the 10 non-pineapple toppings.</li>
            <li><m>{10 \choose 2} = 45</m> choices, since you must select 2 of the remaining 10 non-pineapple toppings to have in addition to the pineapple.</li>
            <li><m>165  = 120 + 45</m> choices, which makes sense because every 3-topping pizza either has pineapple or does not have pineapple as a topping.</li>
          </ol>
        </solution> -->

        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why the coefficient of <m>x^5y^3</m> the same as the coefficient of <m>x^3y^5</m> in the expansion of <m>(x+y)^8</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <!-- <solution>
          <p>
            The coefficient of <m>x^5y^3</m> is <m>{8\choose 5}</m>, since we must pick 5 of the 8 factors to contribute an <m>x</m>. The coefficient of <m>x^3y^5</m> is <m>{8 \choose 3}</m>, since we pick 3 out of the 8 factors to contribute an <m>x</m>. But <m>{8 \choose 5} = {8\choose 3}</m>, because we could just as easily have picked 5 out of the 8 factors to contribute a <m>y</m>.
