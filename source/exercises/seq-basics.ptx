        <p>
          For each sequence given below, find a closed formula for <m>a_n</m>, the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence (assume the first terms are <m>a_0</m>) by relating it to another sequence for which you already know the formula. In each case, briefly say how you got your answers.

                <p>
                  If we subtract 3 from each term, we get <m>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots</m>, which are the powers of 2. So we must shift this sequence up by 3 to get our sequence. Thus
                  <me>
                    a_n = 2^n + 3
                  </me>

                  Add 1 to each term - we get <m>1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, \ldots</m>, the square numbers. So maybe our sequence as formula <m>a_n = n^2 - 1</m>. Does this work? <m>a_3 = 8</m>. That is a term of our sequence, but it should be <m>a_2</m>. So we want
                  <me>
                    a_n = (n+1)^2 - 1
                  </me>

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  Each term is even, so let's see what happens when we divide by 2: we get <m>3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots</m>. These are the triangle numbers, but starting at <m>T_2</m>. We know <m>T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>. We want <m>a_0 = 2T_2</m>, <m>a_1 = 2T_3</m>, and so on. In general, <m>a_n = 2T_{n+2}</m>, so
                  <me>
                    a_n = (n+2)(n+3)
                  </me>

                <p>
                  (This is like a shift by 2 units to the left and a stretch by a factor of 2.)

                  How far off from triangular number are these? The triangular numbers (starting with <m>T_0</m>) are <m>0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, \ldots</m>. The given sequence differs from this by <m>0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, \ldots</m> the square numbers! Thus

          Write out the first few terms of the sequence: <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\ldots</m>. This is surprising at first, but note that we could write <m>2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} + (a_{n-1} -a_{n-2})</m>, and <m>a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> is just the difference between the terms. Initially, the difference between terms is 1, so each time we are just adding one. So we see that <m>a_n = n</m> is the closed formula.

          Find a recursive definition for the sequence with closed formula <m>a_n = 3 + 2n</m>. Bonus points if you can give a recursive definition in which makes use of two previous terms and no constants.

          The sequence we get is <m>3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots</m>. One recursive definition for this is <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 2</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m>. Another option would be to take <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 5</m>.
