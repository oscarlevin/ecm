                A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number, then to the left until you get to second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here. The order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are <m>P(40,3) = 40\cdot 39 \cdot 38</m> different possibilities for the <q>combination</q>. This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be <m>40^3</m>).

              <p>
                Using the digits 2 through 8, find the number of different 5-digit numbers such that:
              <ol>
                <li> <p> Digits can be used more than once. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated, but can come in any order. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Which of the above counting questions is a combination and which is a permutation?  Explain why this makes sense. </p> </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <solution>
              <ol>
                <li> <p> This is just the multiplicative principle.  There are 7 digits which we can select for each of the 5 positions, so we have <m>7^5 = 16807</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Now we have 7 choices for the first number, 6 for the second, etc.  So there are <m>7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = P(7,5) = 2520</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> To build such a number we simply must select 5 different digits.  After doing so, there will only be one way to arrange them into a 5-digit number.  Thus there are <m>{7 \choose 5} = 21</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> The permutation is in part (b), while the combination is in part (c).  At first this seems backwards, since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter.  Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter.  The better way to distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes.  In part (c), there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits, while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives <m>5!</m> different outcomes. </p> </li>

                There are 120 triangles. Here are two ways (there are others as well) to get this:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    First count the triangles with the base on the <m>x</m>-axis. There are <m>{7 \choose 2}</m> ways to pick the base. The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the <m>y</m>-axis (not the origin) so there are a total of <m>{7 \choose 2}4</m> of these triangles. The triangles with base on the <m>y</m> axis can be counted similarly: <m>{5 \choose 2}6</m>. However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the <m>x</m>-axis and also on the <m>y</m>-axis. There are <m>4 \cdot 6</m> right triangles. Thus the total number of triangles is:
                    <me>
                      {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
                    </me>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We must select 3 of the 11 dots. This can be done in <m>{11 \choose 3}</m> ways. However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the <m>x</m>-axis or on the <m>y</m>-axis. There are <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>x</m>-axis. There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>y</m>-axis. Therefore the total number of triangles is
                    <me>
                      {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120

                First, decide where to put the <q>a</q>s. There are 7 positions, and we must choose 3 of them to fill with an <q>a</q>. This can be done in <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways. The remaining 4 spots all get a different letter, so there are <m>4!</m> ways to finish off the anagram. This gives a total of <m>{7 \choose 3}\cdot 4!</m> anagrams. Strangely enough, this is 840, which is also equal to <m>P(7,4)</m>. To get the answer that way, start by picking one of the 7 <em>positions</em> to be filled by the <q>n</q>, one of the remaining 6 positions to be filled by the <q>g</q>, one of the remaining 5 positions to be filled by the <q>r</q>, one of the remaining 4 positions to be filled by the <q>m</q> and then put <q>a</q>s in the remaining 3 positions.

                    Suppose you have 12 chips, each a different color. How many different stacks of 5 chips can you make? Explain your answer and why it is the same as using the formula for <m>P(12,5)</m>.

                    <!-- <solution>
                      <p>
                        There are <m>12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 8 = 95040</m> different stacks of 5 chips. This is because there are 12 choices for which chip goes on bottom, then 11 choices for which comes next, and so on for a total of 5 chips. The formula for <m>P(12,5)</m> is <m>\frac{12!}{7!}</m> - the <m>7!</m> cancels out the part of <m>12!</m> we don't include.

                    Using the scenario of the 12 chips again, what does <m>12!</m> count? What does <m>7!</m> count? Explain.

                    <!-- <solution>
                      <p>
                        <m>12!</m> is the number of different stacks of all 12 chips (12 choices for the bottom chip, 11 for the next, and so on for 12 chips total). <m>7!</m> is the number of 7-chip stacks you can make using just 7 different colored chips (not all 12) because you have 7 choices for the first chip, 6 for the second, and so on.

                    Explain why it makes sense to divide <m>12!</m> by <m>7!</m> when computing <m>P(12,5)</m> (in terms of the chips).

                    <!-- <solution>
                      <p>
                        Say you made all <m>12!</m> stacks of 12 chips. For any particular arrangement of the bottom 5 chips, you will have <m>7!</m> stacks that have that bottom arrangement (one for each arrangement of the remaining 7 chips). But we just want to count the number of 5-chip stacks, so we count all of these as the same outcome (once the top 7 chips are removed, the bottom stacks look identical). Thus we really want to count how many groups there are. All <m>12!</m> stacks are grouped into groups of size <m>7!</m>, so there are <m>12!/7!</m> groups.

                    Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and 5? Explain the formula <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> using the variables <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>.

                    <!-- <solution>
                      <p>
                        <m>P(n,k)</m> counts the number of stacks of size <m>k</m> where the chips come in <m>n</m> different colors (with at most one chip of each color in the stack). You could count this by first forming all stacks of <m>n</m> chips, and there are <m>n!</m> of these. But to get stacks of size <m>k</m>, we don't want the top <m>n-k</m> chips. When we remove <m>n-k</m> chips from the stacks, we sometimes get the same arrangement of the bottom chips. In fact, for each arrangement of the bottom <m>k</m> chips, there are <m>(n-k)!</m> different ways to arrange the top <m>n-k</m> chips, and all of these should count as just 1 outcome. Thus we divide <m>n!</m> by <m>(n-k)!</m> to find the number of <m>k</m>-chip stacks.
