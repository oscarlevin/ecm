    <statement>
      <p>
        For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree.  Remember, a degree sequence lists out the degrees (number of edges incident to the vertex) of all the vertices in a graph in non-increasing order.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(4,1,1,1,1)</m>
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(3,3,2,1,1)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(2,2,2,1,1)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)</m>

            <p>
              This must be the degree sequence for a tree.  This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1 (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get a star.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This cannot be a tree.  Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph.  Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices (and not the other).  That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex, and to each other, so that means there is a cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alternatively, count how many edges there are!

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This might or might not be a tree.  The length 4 path has this degree sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a length 1 path (which is not connected, so not a tree).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This cannot be a tree.  The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14 edges.  But there are 14 vertices as well, so we don't have <m>v = e+1</m>, meaning this cannot be a tree.

    <statement>

        Suppose you have a graph with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges that satisfies <m>v = e+1</m>.  Must the graph be a tree?  Prove your answer.

      </p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No, such a graph need not be a tree.  If the graph has both a cycle and is not connected, it could still have <m>v=e+1</m>.  For example, a graph that consists of a 3-cycle together with a length 1 path will have 5 vertices and 4 edges, but is not a tree.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that any graph (not necessarily a tree) with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges that satisfies <m>v \gt e+1</m> will NOT be connected.

      <p>
        Suppose there was a connected graph <m>G</m> satisfying <m>v \gt e+1</m>.  Let <m>T</m> be a spanning tree of <m>G</m>, and let <m>e'</m> be the number of edges in <m>T</m> (of course the number of vertices in <m>T</m> is <m>v</m>, the same as in <m>G</m>).  Since <m>T</m> is a tree, we have that <m>v = e'+1</m>.  This means that <m>e' \gt e</m>, but that is impossible, since a spanning tree is a subgraph.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Give an example of a graph that has exactly 7 different spanning trees.  Note, it acceptable for some or all of these spanning trees to be isomorphic.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are more complicated ways of doing this, but one example is to start with the cycle <m>C_7</m>.  Any edge that you remove will result in a tree (in fact a path), and there are 7 edges to choose from.  Thus there are exactly 7 spanning trees of this graph.
      </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that every connected graph which is not itself a tree must have at last three different (although possibly isomorphic) spanning trees.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If a connected graph is not a tree, then it has a cycle.  That cycle must consist of at least three edges.  Removing any one of these three edges cannot disconnect the graph, so we can start to form our spanning tree in at least three ways.  NEED TO SAY MORE: WHY CAN WE ALWAY KEEP THE OTHER TWO EDGES?
