  <title>Counting with Recursion</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    What happens when you get stuck on a counting problem?  It is quite easy to miss the clever way of thinking about breaking down a task that leads to a solution.  Here is an example.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your favorite milk-shake diner has 11 stools along the bar.  Patrons of the diner have a rule that no two adjacent stools can be simultaneously occupied.  In how many ways can the stools be occupied by any number of patrons (including no patrons at all, leaving all stools unoccupied)?
  </p>

    <p>
    A first attempt might be to start with stool 1 and realize that it can be sat on or not.  So there are two choices for stool 1.  But now you might have two choices for stool 2 (if stool 1 was not sat on) or only once choice (to keep stool 2 empty, if stool 1 was in use).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.
  </p>


  <p>
    Say you can't think of anything else to try.  The problem seems just too hard.  So make it easier:  11 is way too big of a number; 1 would be much better.  How many ways could a row of 1 stool be occupied?  Let's call this number <m>S_1</m>.  Maybe then we also try the version with 2 and 3 stools.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    Given any graph <m>G = (V, E)</m>, an <term>independent set</term> (of vertices) is a subset <m>I \subseteq V</m> so that no two vertices in <m>I</m> are adjacent.  Suppose you wished to count the number of independent sets of a particular graph.  In this example, lets do so for the path <m>P_{10}</m> (i.e., the graph containing 11 vertices and 10 edges arranged in a line).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's label the vertices 1 through 11, and assume that vertices are adjacent to those with labels one more or one less than themselves (that is, the edge set is <m>E = \{(i,i+1) \st 1 \le i \lt 11\}</m>).  How might you build an independent set?
  </p>

  <p>
    A first attempt might be to start with vertex 1 and realize that you can put it in or keep it out of the independent set.  So there are two choices for vertex 1.  But now you might have two choices for vertex 2 (if vertex 1 was not in the set) or only once choice (to keep vertex 2 out, if vertex 1 was in the set).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.
  </p>

  <p>
    Say you can't think of anything else to try.  The problem seems just too hard.  So make it easier.  10 is way too big of a number; 1 would be much better.  How many independent sets of <m>P_1</m> are there?  Maybe then we also try the version with 2 and 3.

  Once we have a proof that our sequence really does give the answers to all the versions of the counting question we are interested in, then  we can start investigating properties of this sequence.  Sometimes, we might even be able to find a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence, so we can compute values without relying on the recurrence.

  <title>Finding Recurrence Relations</title>

  <p>
    Before investigating properties of sequences given by recurrence relations, we must be able to find those sequences and the recurrence relations.  The following activities give some practice with moving from a counting question to a recurrence relation for the sequence of answers.  You might be able to answer the counting questions with what we have already discovered, but do not do this.  The point of these is to start thinking about these counting problems recursively.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, here is an example of what we are looking for.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a_n</m> be the number of subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 0}</m>.  Prove the recurrence relation is correct.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <!-- <hint>
      <p>
        You should ask yourself, how are the subsets of <m>[n]</m> related to the subsets of <m>[n-1]</m>.  If you are stuck, you could always <q>cheat</q> and use your knowledge of the value of <m>a_n</m>, but try to do this without thinking about that.
      </p>
    </hint> -->
    <solution>
      <p>
        Start by enumerating the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 0}</m>.  There is only 1 subset of the empty set (so <m>a_0 = 1</m>).  There are two subsets of <m>[1]</m>, and four subsets of <m>[2]</m>.  So the sequence looks like <m>1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots</m>.  It <em>appears</em> that the recurrence relation should be <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with initial condition <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To prove this is correct, we <em>must</em> reference the things we are counting (saying that the recurrence agrees with the finitely many terms we have listed is NOT enough).  Consider the <m>a_{n-1}</m> different subsets of <m>[n-1]</m>.  Each of these is a subset of <m>[n]</m>, in particular, a subset of <m>[n]</m> that does not include the number <m>n</m> as an element.  Further, to each of these sets, we can add the element <m>n</m> to get another distinct subset of <m>[n]</m>.  So far, we have found <m>2a_{n-1}</m> subsets of <m>[n]</m>.  Actually, we have found all of them: every subset of <m>[n]</m> either includes <m>n</m> or it does not.   
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Now here are some for you to try.

    </p>

      </p>
    </statement>

        What would you need to do to the graph <m>K_n</m> to get the graph <m>K_{n-1}</m>?  How does this affect the number of edges?

        Let <m>b_n</m> be the number of bijections from an <m>n</m>-element set to an <m>n</m>-element set.  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> and prove you are correct.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        To determine a bijection <m>f:[n] \to [n]</m>, you could first say what <m>f(n)</m> is.  What do you still need to do?  Your answer to this question should be one single step (that inductively, you know how to do).

  <exploration xml:id="HanoiProblem" category="interesting">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <q>Towers of Hanoi</q> puzzle has three rods rising from a rectangular base with <m>n</m> rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod. A legal move consists of moving a ring from one rod to another so that it does not land on top of a smaller ring. If <m>m_n</m> is the number of moves required to move all the rings from the initial rod to another rod that you choose, give a recurrence for <m>m_n</m>.

        Suppose you already knew the number of moves needed to solve the puzzle with <m>n-1</m> rings.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can solve the puzzle in one step if there is one ring, so <m>m_1=1</m>. If <m>n>0</m> and we want to move all the rings from the initial rod to rod 3, then first we solve the problem of moving all but the bottom ring to rod 2; this takes <m>m_{n-1}</m> steps, then we move the bottom ring to rod 3, then we solve the problem of moving all the remaining rings from rod 2 to rod 3. Thus we have <m>m_n=2m_{n-1}+1</m>.

  <exploration xml:id="circlesinplane" category="interesting">
    <statement>
      <p>
        We draw <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles in the plane so that each one crosses each other one exactly twice and no three intersect in the same point. (As examples, think of Venn diagrams with two or three mutually intersecting sets.) Find a recurrence for the number <m>r_n</m> of regions into which the plane is divided by <m>n</m> circles. (One circle divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside.) Find the number of regions with <m>n</m> circles. For what values of <m>n</m> can you draw a Venn diagram showing all the possible intersections of <m>n</m> sets using circles to represent each of the sets?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        If we have <m>n - 1</m> circles drawn in such a way that they define <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and we draw a new circle, each time it crosses another circle, except for the last time, it finishes dividing one region into two parts and starts dividing a new region into two parts.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Compare <m>r_n</m> with the number of subsets of an <m>n</m>-element set.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>
        One circle defines two regions, the inside and outside. When we draw a second circle that intersects the first, we can start at one of the intersection points and go inside the first circle, cutting its region into two pieces, and then when we leave it we cut the outside region into two pieces. This suggests the general pattern. If we have drawn <m>n-1</m> circles and start a new one, each time we enter a circle, we start dividing a region into two pieces. Each time we leave a circle, we also start dividing a region into two pieces. 
        Thus if we have <m>r_n</m> regions with <m>n</m> circles, to get the number of regions, we note that in going from <m>n-1</m> circles to <m>n</m> circles, we start with <m>r_{n-1}</m> regions, and divide <m>2(n-1)</m> of them in half, so we get <m>2n-2</m> new regions. This gives us <m>r_n=r_{n-1}+2(n-1)</m>. 
        Notice that by substitution of the formula <m>r_{n-1}=r_{n-2} +2(n-2)</m>, we get <m>r_n=r_{n-2}+ 2(n-2) +2(n-1)</m>, and would guess that <m>r_n=r_{n-3}+2(n-3)+2(n-2) +2(n-1)</m>. This leads to the conjecture <me>   r_n=r_1  +2\cdot1+2\cdot2+\cdots+2\cdot(n-1)=r_1+2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}   i=2+n(n-1). </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can prove this formula by induction. When <m>n=1</m> we have <m>2+1\cdot0</m> regions. Assuming that <m>n-1</m> circles give us <m>2+(n-1)(n-2)</m> regions, for <m>n</m> circles we have <m>2+(n-1)(n-2) +2(n-1)=2+n(n-1)</m> regions. Thus the correctness of our formula for <m>n-1</m> circles implies its correctness when we have <m>n</m> circles, so for all positive integers <m>n</m>, we get <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions determined by <m>n</m> mutually intersecting circles. Two circles cannot touch more than twice, and if we let some of our <m>n</m> circles touch just once, or not at all, that would reduce the number of regions we would get.
        Similarly, allowing a circle to go through the intersection point of two other circles could only reduce the number of regions. So with <m>n</m> circles we could never have more than <m>2+n(n-1)</m> regions. In particular with 4 circles we get just 14 regions, rather than the 16 that would be required in a Venn diagram for four sets. We could prove, again by induction, that <m>2+n(n-1)\lt 2^n</m> for all <m>n>3</m>, so it is not possible to draw a Venn diagram using circles to illustrate the intersections of four or more sets.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    The sequences above all have relatively simple recurrence relations.  In particular, the recursions all make reference only to one previous term.  This need not be the case, as we saw when counting bar stool seating charts and as the next few problems demonstrate.

  <title>Using Recurrence Relations</title>

  <p>
    While it is often easier to find a recurrence relation governing a sequence, if we wish to use sequences to solve counting problems, we would really like to be able to find a closed formula for the terms in a sequence. If this is not possible, we can still use the recurrence relation to learn something about how the sequence behaves.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will start by consider some simple classes of recurrence relations for which we can find closed formulas.
  </p>

  <activity xml:id="act-arithmetic">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(a_n)_{n \le 0}</m> satisfy <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 3</m> with <m>a_0 = 2</m>.  For example, <m>a_n</m> might give the number of push-ups you can do <m>n</m> days into your training, assuming you can do 3 more push-ups each day, if you could do 2 push-ups before you started training.  Find a closed formula for <m>a_n</m> and justify your answer.  Show how the recurrence relation is used.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        If you write out the sequence, it would be easy to guess at a closed formula, but the point here is to <em>use</em> the recurrence relation somehow.  Consider rewriting the recurrence relation as <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2</m>.  Note that <m>a_n - a_0 = (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) + \cdots + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_1 - a_0)</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </activity>

  <activity xml:id="act-geometric">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(a_n)_{n \le 0}</m> satisfy <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 2</m>.  For example, <m>a_n</m> might give the number of <m>n</m>-scoop ice-cream cones you can make from 3 available flavors in one of two kinds of cones.  Find a closed formula for <m>a_n</m> and justify your answer.  Show how the recurrence relation is used.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Again, if you write out the sequence, it would be easy to guess at a closed formula.  To see how the recurrence relation is used, try substituting in earlier values.  For example, <m>a_2 = 3a_1</m>, but <m> a_1 = 3a_0</m>, so <m>a_2 = 3(3a_0) = 3^2a_0</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </activity>

  <p>
    The sequence in <xref ref="act-arithmetic"/> is an example of an <term>arithmetic sequence</term> (or arithmetic progression) in that the difference between terms is constant.  The sequence in <xref ref="act-geometric"/> is an example of a <term>geometric sequence</term> (or geometric progression) because the <em>ratio</em> between terms is constant.  Of course there is nothing special about 2 and 3 in the activities, so you should now see how to find the closed formula for any arithmetic or geometric sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The techniques used to get those closed formulas are also worth pointing out.  The method suggested in the hint to <xref ref="act-arithmetic"/> is called <term>telescoping</term> and the method suggested for <xref ref="act-geometric"/> is called <term>iteration</term>.
  </p>

  <!-- TODO: add examples of telescoping or iteration here? -->


  <!-- TODO: Add examples of sums of arithmetic and geometric sequences? -->


  <p>
    Most sequences are not arithmetic, but it is still helpful to look at the difference between terms.  Often if we know something about the sequence of differences, we can deduce something about the original sequence.   We can also think about this as starting with the sequence of differences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given any sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m>, we can form the <term>sequence of partial sums</term> <m>(b_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> given by <m>b_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_n</m>.  That is, <m>b_n</m> tells you what you get if you add up the first <m>n</m> terms of <m>(a_n)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that <m>(b_n)</m> satisfies the recurrence relation <m>b_n = b_{n-1} + a_n</m>, or equivalently <m>b_n - b_{n-1} = a_n</m>.  So <m>(a_n)</m> is the sequence of differences of its sequence of partial sums!

  <p>
    The previous activity shows that the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence is always a quadratic sequence.  Conversely, any quadratic sequence should arise in this way.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> with a quadratic closed formula, say <m>b_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>, what will the closed formula for the sequence of differences be?  That is, what is the closed formula for <m>a_n = b_n - b_{n-1}</m>?  Why does this show that every quadratic sequence is the sequence of partial sums for some arithmetic sequence?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>
  
  <p>
    The above observations can be generalized: a cubic sequence will have quadratic difference, a quartic sequence will have cubic differences, and so on.  This allows us to guess at the <em>form</em> of a closed formula for a polynomial sequence by taking successive differences.  If the <q>third differences</q> of a sequence are constant, then we would guess we could find a cubic polynomial.  Given the first 4 terms, we can fit the cubic to them by setting up a system of 4 equations and 4 unknowns.
  </p>



   <p>
    Sequences of partial sums are also useful for geometric sequences.  The following technique will likely be familiar from calculus when you worked with geometric series.

        What is <m>3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + \cdots + 12288</m>?  Call the sum <m>S</m> and compute <m>S - 2S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Multiply each term by 2, the common ratio.
        You get <m>2S = 6 + 12 + 24 + \cdots + 24576</m>.
        Now subtract: <m>2S - S = -3 + 24576 = 24573</m>.
        Since <m>2S - S = S</m>, we have our answer.
      </p>

    The idea is, by multiplying the sum by the common ratio,

    leaving just the first term and new last term.

        The only real difference is that we are now computing an

        we do not have the extra <q>last</q> term to consider.

      <p>
        Consider the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}</m>.  Listing terms (with some reasonable initial conditions) suggests that this sequence grows exponentially.

          Show that <m>a_n = 2^n</m> and <m>a_n = 3^n</m> are both solutions to the recurrence relation.  That is, they are sequences for which the recurrence relation holds.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You could do a full proof by induction here, but really you are just plugging these in to see if the recurrence works for them.

      <statement>

      <statement>

          Might there be another solution to the recurrence relation?  Suppose <m>a_n = r^n</m> for some non-zero constant <m>r</m>.  Show that <m>r = 2</m> or <m>r = 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          If you do the substitution, you will get a degree <m>n</m> polynomial equation in the variable <m>r</m>.  Solving that equation amounts to finding the roots of the polynomial.

  <p>
    This is a partial justification of the <term>characteristic root technique</term> (the polynomial whose roots are the base of the exponentials is called the <term>characteristic polynomial</term>).  Making the reasonable guess that recurrence relations which give <m>a_n</m> as a linear combination of <m>a_{n-1}</m> and <m>a_{n-2}</m> should have exponential closed formulas allows you to find the bases of those exponentials.  You can then use the initial conditions to find the constants <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>.  Let's illustrate this process with an example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="eg_char-roots">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a closed formula for the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> given recursively by <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}</m> with initial conditions <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 13</m>.  (This is the sequence of colorful square/domino paths from <xref ref="act-dominoes"/>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <!-- <hint>
      <p>
        Guess that <m>r^n</m> is a solution, and use this to find two roots <m>r_1, r_2</m> of a polynomial.  Then use <m>3 = \alpha r_1^1 + \beta r_2^1</m> and <m>13 = \alpha r_1^2 + \beta r_2^2</m> to find <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>.
      </p>
    </hint> -->
    <solution>
      <p>
        From the recurrence relation we have <m>a_n - 3a_{n-1} - 4a_{n-2} = 0</m>.  We transform this into the characteristic equation <m>x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0</m>.  
        This has roots <m>x = 4</m> and <m>x = -1</m>.  So we guess that the closed formula for <m>a_n</m> will be <m>a_n = \alpha 4^n + \beta (-1)^n</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To find <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>, we use the initial conditions.   When <m> n = 1</m> we have <m> 3 = 4\alpha -\beta</m>.  When <m>n = 2</m> we have <m> 13 = 16\alpha + \beta</m>.  It is easy to solve this system of two equations and two unknowns (simply adding them together eliminates the <m>\beta</m>).  We find <m>\alpha = \frac{4}{5}</m> and <m>\beta = \frac{1}{5}</m>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus the closed formula is <me>a_n = \frac{4}{5} 4^n + \frac{1}{5} (-1)^n</me>.

  <p>
    There are many subtle and interesting variations on solving recurrence relations, and we will not explore them all here.  To conclude though, we consider one interesting case that will show up later as well.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> with initial conditions <m>a_0 = 1</m> and <m>a_1 = 2</m>.

  <p>
    As you saw above, something goes wrong with the characteristic root technique when the roots of the characteristic equation are repeated.  One way around this is to guess that the closed formula should be <me>a_n = \alpha r^n + \beta nr^n</me>, where <m>r</m> is the repeated root and <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are constants determined by the initial conditions as normal. The key here is to add an extra multiple of <m>n</m> to the second term.

  <title>Exploring the Fibonacci Sequence</title>

  <p>
    Even though we are thinking of sequences as a tool for solving counting questions, it is often very rewarding to step back and observe the beauty and elegance of a sequence in its own right.  So to conclude this section, we will consider a few delightful observations about the most famous recursively defined sequence: the Fibonacci numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For consistency, let's agree that <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number, where <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m>, and for all other <m>n</m>, <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m>.
  </p>
  
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine a formula for the sum <m>F_{0} + F_{1} + F_{2} + \ldots + F_{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        If we collect some initial data we see that the sequence of partial sums is <m>0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, \ldots</m>.  We might recognize these numbers as always one less than a Fibonacci number, and guess that 
        <me>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdot + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We could prove this by induction, but for fun, here is a clever observation that finishes the problem: <m>F_k = F_{k+2} - F_{k+1}</m> (just rearrange the recurrence relation).  Now replace each term after <m>F_0</m>:
        <me> F_0 + (F_3 - F_2) + (F_4 - F_3) + (F_5 - F_4) + \cdots + (F_{n+1} - F_n)+ (F_{n+2} - F_{n+1})</me>.
        Almost every term cancels (telescopes) leaving only 
        <me>-F_1 + F_{n+2}</me>
        which is of course what we are looking for.

          Prove <m>\binom{n}{0}F_{0} + \binom{n}{1}F_{1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n}F_{n} = F_{2n}</m> in two ways.  First, use the Binet Formula from <xref ref="act-binet"/>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          Starting on the right side, use the Binet formula and the fact that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> satisfy <m>x^2 - x - 1 = 0</m>:
          <me>
            F_{2n} = \frac{a^{2n} - b^{2n}}{a-b} = \frac{(a+1)^n - (b+1)^n}{a-b}

          Then expand the two binomials using the binomial theorem:

          Now group like terms:

            <mrow>F_{2n} = \amp \binom{n}{0}\frac{a^0-b^0}{a-b} + \binom{n}{1}\frac{a-b}{a-b} + \binom{n}{2}\frac{a^2-b^2}{a-b}+\cdots + \binom{n}{n}\frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b} </mrow>
