  <title>Partitions of Sets</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Partitions are one of the core ideas in discrete mathematics.  Recall that a <term>partition</term> of a set <m>S</m> is a collection of mutually disjoint subsets of <m>S</m> whose union is all of <m>S</m>.  In other words, every element of <m>S</m> belongs to exactly one of the subsets of the partition.  We call the subsets that make up the partition <term>blocks</term> or <term>parts</term> of the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integers can be naturally partitioned into evens and odds.  In fact, this is just a specific case of partitioning the integers by their reminder when divided by a fixed constant; another example is that every integer has remainder 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finite sets also have natural partitions: the set of all 4-bit strings can be partitioned according to weight: <me>\B^4_0 \cup \B^4_1 \cup \B^4_2 \cup \B^4_3 \cup \B^4_4 = \B^4</me>.
      Using the sum principle on these disjoint sets leads directly to the identity
      <m>\binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{4} = 2^4</m>
      (and of course the 4 can be replaced with any <m>n</m> here).
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, many of the identities we established in <xref ref="sec_basic-proofs" /> using a combinatorial proof work precisely because we can count a set of outcomes all at once and also by counting the size of each block in a particular partition.  For example, in <xref ref="act_derangement-binom" /> we proved that
      <me>\binom{n}{0} d_{0} + \binom{n}{1} d_{1} + \binom{n}{2} d_{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} d_{n} = n!</me>
      by partitioning the <m>n!</m> permutations of <m>[n]</m> into blocks according to how many are fixed in position while the rest are deranged.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the formula for binomial coefficients, <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}</m>, comes from partitioning the <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>[n]</m> into blocks according to which subset of <m>[n]</m> is selected (and then <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> is precisely the number of blocks).
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section we will abstract this fundamental idea of partitions by one level.  Instead of using particular partitions to answer counting questions, we will ask counting questions about partitions themselves.  As we will see, this helps us solve yet more counting questions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_basic-quotient"/> we considered some ways to distribute items to recipients.  Most basic counting formulas can be thought of as counting the number of ways to distribute either distinct or identical items to distinct recipients.  For example, distributing <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> distinct recipients can be done in <m>n^k</m> ways, if recipients can receive any number of items, or <m>P(n,k)</m> ways if recipients can receive at most one item.  If the items are identical, the corresponding number of ways to distribute them are <m>\mchoose{n}{k}</m> and <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if the recipients are not distinct?  Say we wish to distribute <m>k</m> books (either distinct or identical) to <m>n</m> identical boxes.  This is a perfectly natural extension, but we will see the answer is not.  First, let's get a feel for what this might look like for some small values of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>.

    <p>
      Both of the previous two activities can be solved by counting partitions.  The difference comes down to whether we partition a set of distinct objects or identical objects.  It is not immediately clear how to model partitioning identical objects, and we will put this off until <xref ref="sec_adv-linearparts"/>.  Partitioning <em>distinct</em> objects simply means finding a partition of a set, the topic of the current section.

  <subsection>
    <title>Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind</title>

    <p>
      We would like to count the number of ways to partition a set.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-stirling">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Denote by <m>S(k,n)</m> the number of partitions of <m>[k]</m> into exactly <m>n</m> subsets.  We call <m>S(k,n)</m> a <term>Stirling number (of the second kind)</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Note that we write <m>S(k,n)</m> instead of <m>S(n,k)</m> here because we try to use <m>k</m> for the number of elements being distributed and <m>n</m> for the number of recipients.  When other books use <m>S(n,k)</m>, they mean the number of partitions of <m>[n]</m> into exactly <m>k</m> blocks.  This is the same definition as we give, but with our renamed variables the formulas we get might look different.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, consider how to partition <m>[3]</m> into exactly two sets:
      <me>
        \{1,2\}, \{3\} \qquad \qquad \{1,3\},\{2\} \qquad \qquad \{2,3\},\{1\}
      </me>
      and that is all, so <m>S(3,2) = 3</m>.  We do not care about the order the elements appear in each block, nor the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus we see the Stirling numbers count the number of ways to distribute <m>k</m> distinct items to <m>n</m> identical recipients so that each recipient gets at least one item.

        <solution>
          <p>
            If a partition has <m>k-1</m> parts, then one part has two elements, so once we choose those two elements from the <m>k</m> elements, we are done.  Therefore <m>S(k,k-1) = \binom{k}{2}</m>.

      We can arrange the Stirling numbers into a triangle (called <term>Stirling's second triangle</term>).  The first five rows are shown below.  The entries are indexed differently than in Pascal's triangle: the top 1 represents <m>S(1,1)</m>, so for example, <m>S(5,2) = 15</m>.

    <p>
      Now that you have some experience with listing the <m>S(4,3)</m> partitions of <m>[4]</m>, the next example will help us to generalize.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's see how to take <m>S(4,2) = 7</m> and <m>S(4,3) = 6</m> to compute <m>S(5,3) = 25</m>.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          First, here are the partitions of <m>[4]</m> into 2 blocks (group A) or 3 blocks (group B), side by side:
        </p>
        
        <sidebyside widths="50% 30%" valign="top">

        <p>
          Now, to list the <m>S(5,3)</m> partitions of <m>[5]</m> into <m>3</m> parts, we need to add 5 somewhere.  We can either
          <ol label="a.">
            <li>
              <p>
                Let 5 be a singleton block, along with any of the partitions from group A; or
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Let 5 join any of the blocks in any of the partitions of group B.  
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          The second option can be accomplished in <m>3\cdot 6</m> ways.  Thus <m>S(5,3) = 7 + 3\cdot 6</m>.

        We have often thought of counting problems as asking about how many functions there are from a <m>k</m>-elements set to an <m>n</m>-element set.  The answer to this question is <m>n^k</m> for all functions and <m>P(n,k)</m> for injective functions.  What about surjective functions?  There is a reason we haven't asked this question yet, but now we can at least get an expression for the number of surjections in terms of Stirling numbers.

              Each function from a <m>k</m>-element set <m>K</m> to an <m>n</m>-element set <m>N</m> is a function from <m>K</m> onto <em>some</em> subset of <m>N</m>.

    <title>Formulas for Stirling Numbers (of the second kind)</title>

    <p>
      Here is a brief summary of what we have already discovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Directly from the definition, we see that <m>S(k,1) = 1</m> and <m>S(k,k) = 1</m>.  From these we can compute the remaining Stirling numbers using the recursion
      <me>
        S(k,n) = nS(k-1,n) + S(k-1, n-1).
      </me>
      This recursion is justified by dividing the partitions of <m>[k]</m> into those which contain <m>k</m> as a singleton set (there are <m>S(k-1, n-1)</m> of these) and those that don't (there are <m>n</m> choices for where <m>k</m> could be for each of the <m>S(k-1, n)</m> partitions of <m>[k-1]</m> into <m>n</m> blocks).
    </p>

    <p>
      From this, we generated Stirling's second triangle.

      Let's consider some ways to compute Stirling numbers directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we might not have a nice closed formula for all Stirling numbers in terms of <m>k</m> and <m>n</m>, we can give closed formulas for those Stirling numbers close to the edges of the triangle.  We have already considered some of these in <xref ref="act_stirlingcomputations"/>.  To get back into the right mindset, start by reproving one of these.

      <solution>
        <p>
          If a partition has <m>k-1</m> parts, then one part has two elements, so once we choose those two elements from the <m>k</m> elements, we are done.  Therefore <m>S(k,k-1) = \binom{k}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      The proof of the formula above suggests that looking at the sizes of the blocks might be helpful.  Let's see what this might look like with an example.

        <solution>
          <p>
            There will be <m>10 = \binom{5}{3}</m>.  Once you select the three elements to be in the block of size 3, the other two must be in blocks of size 1 each.

            Careful here.  The answer is NOT <m>\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2}</m>.  Do you see why?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We can select two elements to be in a block of size 2 in <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> ways.  Then you can select two of the remaining elements for the block of size 2 in <m>\binom{3}{2}</m> ways.  However, just multiplying these two double counts since we do not care about the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus there are <m>\frac{1}{2}\binom{5}{2}\binom{3}{2} = 15</m> partition of <m>[5]</m> of this type.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Any partition of 5 into 3 blocks must have at least one element in each block; the remaining two elements could be in a block together or two different blocks.  So the two cases above are all the cases.  This tell us <m>S(5,3) = 25</m>.

            <m>S(k, k-2) = \binom{k}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m>.  Because we have two fewer blocks than we have elements, there will always either be a block of size three and <m>k-3</m> blocks of size one or two blocks of size two and <m>k-4</m> blocks of size 1.  The first case accounts for <m>\binom{k}{3}</m> partitions (once you have chosen the three elements to be in the large block, you are done).  The second case accounts for <m>\frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m> partitions (pick 2 elements to be together, then 2 of the remaining to be together, but don't care which order you pick these in).

          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If you found this formula for <m>S(k,k-2)</m> in part (e), then pretend your friend claims that <m>S(k, k-2) = \binom{k}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\binom{k}{2}\binom{k-2}{2}</m> and prove why that is correct too.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The <m>\binom{k}{3}</m> still counts the partitions in which one block has size three.  Now we can pick four elements to be in the two blocks of size 2 in <m>\binom{k}{4}</m> ways.  But these four elements can be broken into two equally sized blocks in 3 ways (pick the cell-mate of the first element).

        <m>\binom{9}{3}\binom{6}{3}\binom{3}{3}/3!</m>. First we choose
        three sandwiches for bag 1, then three for bag 2, and put the remainder in

          The <m>\frac{9!}{3!3!3!}</m> suggests another solution. We can line up the

          When we use the distributive law to multiply out <m>(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n)^k</m>, we will get a sum of a bunch of terms of the form <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> where <m>i_1+i_2+\cdots+ i_n=k</m>.  The terms with a given sequence <m>i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n</m> of exponents will arise from choosing, as we apply the distributive law over and over again, <m>x_1</m> from <m>i_1</m> of the factors, <m>x_2</m> from <m>i_2</m> of the factors, and so on. Thus the number of terms <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the number of ways to label <m>i_1</m> of the factors with a 1, <m>i_2</m> of the factors with a 2, <ellipsis />, and <m>i_n</m> of the factors with an <m>n</m>. The number of ways to do this is a multinomial coefficient, as we now explain. This labeling gives us a function from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> as follows. If factor <m>i</m> is labelled <m>j</m> we let <m>f(i) =j</m>. Further each function <m>f</m> from <m>[k]</m> to <m>[n]</m> gives us that maps <m>i_j</m> elements of <m>[k]</m> to <m>j</m> will give us such a labelling. Thus the coefficient of <m>x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> will be the multinomial coefficient <m>\binom{k}{i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_n}</m>.

            The following argument is due to Polya.
            Suppose you wished to paint n houses and you have <m>k</m> different colors available.
            The first house can be painted in <m>k</m> different ways, the second in <m>k</m> different ways, etc.
            So there are <m>k^{n}</m> ways.
            How many ways actually use all <m>k</m> colors?
            Let <m>\alpha_{i}</m> be the property that no house is painted with the <m>i</m>th color, and let <m>N(\alpha_{i})</m> denote the number of ways of painting the <m>n</m> houses without using the <m>i</m>th color.
            Analogously for <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j})</m>, <m>N(\alpha_{i},\alpha_{j},\alpha_{k})</m>, etc.
            Since <m>N(\alpha_{i}) = (k - 1)^{n}</m>, <m>N(a_{i},\alpha_{j}) = ( k - 2)^{n}</m> and so on, the number of ways of painting <m>n</m> houses using all <m>k</m> colors is, using PIE,
            <m>k^{n} -\binom{k}{1} \left(k - 1 \right)^{n} + \binom{k}{2} \left( k - 2 \right)^{n} - \binom{k}{3}      \left( k - 3 \right)^{n} + \ldots + \left( - 1 \right)^{k}\binom{k}{k} 0^{n}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternately, we could first partition the <m>n</m> houses into <m>k</m> (non-empty) sets, and then paint each set. This can be    accomplished in <m>k!S(n,k)</m> ways. Now equate these two expressions.

      Recognizing that the factors that involve <m>x</m> look like a factorial, we can convert them into binomial coefficients, which is what <xref ref="thm-stirling-polynomial2"/> says:
      <me>
        x^3 = \binom{x}{1} + 3\binom{x}{2}2! + \binom{x}{3}3! = \binom{x}{1} + 6\binom{x}{2} + 6 \binom{x}{3}.
      </me>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Less we think this is nothing more than an interesting factoid, we can use it to establish the following.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2</m>.  In other words, the square of any triangular number is the sum of cubes!
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We recognize that each cube on the left-hand side can be expressed as <m>\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}</m>.  Thus
          <md>
            <mrow>1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \left(\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> = \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{1} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{2} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{3}</mrow>
          </md>.
          Now each of the three sums of binomial coefficients can be simplified using the Hockey Stick Theorem, to get
          <md>
            <mrow> =  \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6 \binom{n+1}{3} + 6 \binom{n+1}{4} </mrow>
            <mrow> = \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\left(\binom{n+1}{3}+\binom{n+1}{4}\right) </mrow>
            <mrow> = \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\binom{n+2}{4} </mrow>
          </md>
          where the last step uses the Pascal triangle recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, write these last two binomial coefficients using the factorial formula and simplify:
          <me>
            \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n(n-1)}{4} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
          </me>.

  <title>Bell Numbers</title>

    <p>
      The Bell number, <m>B_{k}</m>, denotes the number of ways that a set of <m>k</m> objects can be partitioned into nonempty subsets.
      We have already seen how to partition a set of <m>k</m> objects into exactly <m>n</m> subsets: <m>S(k,n)</m>.  So then <m>B_k = \sum_{n=1}^kS(k,n)</m>.  We take <m>B_0 = 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sequence of Bell numbers starts
      <me>
        1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, \ldots
      </me>
      Notice that the first four numbers look like Catalan numbers.  In fact, one of the many things the Catalan numbers count are <em>non-crossing</em> set partitions.<fn>A set partition is said to be <term>non-crossing</term> as long as whenever <m>a,b</m> belong to one block and <m>c,d</m> belong to another, we have that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both either larger or smaller than both of <m>c</m> and <m>d</m>.</fn>  So if <m>C_n</m> counts only some of the set partitions, then it must be that <m>C_n \le B_n</m> for all <m>n</m>.
    </p>


    <p>
      The Bell numbers can be generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a 2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues.

    <p>
      To summarize, construction of the triangle follows two basic rules:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The last number of each row is the first number of the next row.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All other numbers are found by adding the number to the left of the
            missing number to the number directly above this same number.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      When the triangle is extended, as above, the Bell Numbers are found down
      the first column as well as along the outside diagonal.

      As with Pascal's Triangle, the Bell triangle has several interesting
      properties.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the sum of a row is added to the Bell number at the end of that row, the next Bell number is obtained. For example, the sum of the fourth row plus the Bell number at the end of the row: <m>15 + 20 + 27 + 37 + 52 + 52</m> is 203, the next Bell number.  Why does this happen?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exploration>

    <exploration>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Another pattern you might notice: the numbers of the second diagonal <m>1, 3, 10, 37, 151, 674, \ldots</m> are the sums of the horizontal rows.  Prove this!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      Rotating the triangle slightly creates a <em>difference</em> triangle analogous to Pascal's Triangle. The entries that are formed recursively by adding in Pascal's Triangle are now differences of the two numbers above them in the Bell triangle.

    <p>
      The Bell numbers are related to the Stirling numbers and can be defined
      as the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
      That is, <m>B_{k} = S(k,1) + S(k,2) + \cdots + S(k,k)</m>, where <m>S(k,n)</m> represents the number of ways of grouping <m>k</m> elements into <m>n</m> subsets.
      So <m>B_{3} = S(3,1) + S(3,2) + S(3,3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5</m>.
      Since the Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of elements, they are used in prime-number theory to enumerate the number of ways to factor a number with distinct prime factors.
      For example, 42 has three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7.
      Since <m>B_{3} = 5</m> , we know there are five ways of factoring 42.
      These are <m>2 \times 3 \times 7</m>, <m>2 \times 21</m>, <m>3 \times 14</m>, <m>6 \times 7</m>, and <m>42</m>.
      So the number <m>210</m>, which has 4 distinct factors, 2, 3, 5, and 7, can be factored in <m>B_{4} = 15</m> ways.
    </p>



    <p>
      The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For
      example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled
      twin beds is <m>B_{2} = 2</m> ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in
      separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of
      three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is <m>B_{3} = 5</m> ways:
      each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on
      one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on
      another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example
      serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three
      unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed
      together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any
      situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty
      subsets.
    </p>

    <p>
      One interesting application of Bell numbers is in counting the number of
      rhyme schemes possible for a stanza in poetry. There are <m>B_{2} = 2</m> possibilities for a two-line stanza: the lines can either rhyme or not
      rhyme. The possible rhyme schemes of a three-line stanza can be
      described as aaa, aab, aba, abb, and abc: thus there are 5 or <m>B_{3}</m> possible rhyme schemes. The Japanese used diagrams depicting possible
      rhyme schemes of a five-line stanza <m>B_{5} = 52</m> as early as 1000
      A.D. in the <em>Tale of the Genji</em> by Lady Shikibu Murasaki.
